Simulate Lyotropic Liquid Crystal Membranes
===========================================

Background
----------

Lyotropic liquid crystals (LLC) are amphiphilic molecules that 
can self-assemble into various ordered phases depending on the 
amount of water present in solution. LLC monomers with crosslinkable
functional groups can be reacted in order to create stable and
mechanically robust films that can be used as separations membranes. 

The hydrophilic pores of cross-linked nanostructured LLC membranes are 
uniform in size which makes them ideal for selective separations. 

We are most interested in the hexagonal (H_II) and bicontinuous cubic phases
formed by LLC membranes because the
