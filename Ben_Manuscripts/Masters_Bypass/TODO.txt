DO THE EASY STUFF FIRST

- Crosslinking figures - pores shrinking. Distribution of xlinks between monomer, monomer above/below, across pbcs etc. Maybe move to results.
- zdf of offset and parallel displaced
- fill in pore spacing table
- Order parameter plots
- Diffraction patterns of restrained systems
- Get spacing of pi-stacking modes
- traj punch diffraction patterns
- Ionic conductivity
- subsections?
