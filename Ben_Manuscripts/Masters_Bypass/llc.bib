	abstract = {Electrodialysis is a promising process to treat saline water containing organic solute. The desalination performances are fixed by the transfer of salts and organic solutes. On the contrary to the transfer of salts, few results were reported regarding that of organic compounds. This is the objective of this work to investigate the transfer of neutral organic solutes (acetic acid, phenol, glucose) through ion-exchange membranes, focusing on the influence of the salt (NaCl, MgCl2, Na2SO4). Results show that the water transfer due to electroosmosis depends on the salt composition following the ion hydration. Two contributions, diffusion and convection, are pointed out for the transfer of organic solutes. Both are important and mainly fixed by steric effect. Concerning the influence of the ion hydration, reverse trends are found for both contributions. Decreasing diffusion flux is observed for increasing membrane counter-ion hydration showing the influence of the membrane structural properties. Increasing convection flux is observed for increasing ion hydration showing the influence of the solute hydration.},

	volume = {25},
	abstract = {Thermodynamic integration is a widely used method to calculate and analyze the effect of a chemical modification on the free energy of a chemical or biochemical process, for example, the impact of an amino acid substitution on protein association. Numerical fluctuations can introduce large uncertainties, limiting the domain of application of the method. The parametric energy function describing the chemical modification in the thermodynamic integration, the “alchemical path”, determines the amplitudes of the fluctuations. In the present work, I propose a measure of the fluctuations in the thermodynamic integration and an approach to search for a parametric energy path minimizing that measure. The optimal path derived with this approach is very close to the theoretical minimum of the measure, but produces nonergodic sampling. Nevertheless, this path is used to guide the design of a practical and efficient path producing correct sampling. The convergence with this practical path is evaluated on test cases, and compares favorably with that of other methods such as power or polynomial path, soft-core van der Waals, and some other approaches presented in the literature.

	abstract = {Amyloid fibril formation is assumed to be the molecular basis for a variety of diseases of unrelated origin. Despite its fundamental clinical importance, the mechanism of amyloid formation is not fully understood. When we analyzed a variety of short functional fragments from unrelated amyloid-forming proteins, a remarkable occurrence of aromatic residues was observed. The finding of aromatic residues in diverse fragments raises the possibility that π-π interactions may play a significant role in the molecular recognition and self-assembly processes that lead to amyloid formation. This is in line with the well-known central role of π-stacking interactions in self-assembly processes in the fields of chemistry and biochemistry. We speculate that the stacking interactions may provide energetic contribution as well as order and directionality in the self-assembly of amyloid structures. Experimental data regarding amyloid formation and inhibition by short peptide analogs also support our hypothesis. The π-stacking hypothesis suggests a new approach to understanding the self-assembly mechanism that governs amyloid formation and indicates possible ways to control this process.—Gazit, E.

	abstract = {A critical assessment of previous theoretical descriptions of membrane nanofiltration shows that the good agreement with experimental data is due to the use of the ratio of effective membrane thickness to membrane porosity as an arbitrary fitting parameter. A more rigorous analysis shows that rejection is independent of membrane thickness.

A model allowing calculation of uncharged solute rejection on the basis of a single membrane parameter (pore radius) is developed. The theoretical description is based on a hydrodynamic model of hindered solute transport in pores. The dependence of solute chemical potential on pressure is included, although its effect is shown to be small. A variation of solvent viscosity with pore radius is also included. For pores of a single size, such variation has no effect on rejection, though it will become important for overall membrane rejection if a pore size distribution is included. The good agreement between this model and experimental data confirms that uncharged solute rejection in nanofiltration membranes may be well-described by such a continuum model.

A two-parameter model (pore radius and membrane charge) for electrolyte rejection has been developed that includes dielectric exclusion in the form of an energy barrier to ion partitioning into the pores. Reassessment of the pore dielectric constant using NaCl rejection at the isoelectric point of a Desal-DK membrane resulted in significantly better agreement with experimental rejection data than use of the high frequency solvent dielectric constant for an oriented layer of water molecules at the pore walls. The predicted values of effective membrane charge density were not only significantly reduced in magnitude, and hence more realistic, than those from previous models, but their variation with concentration for divalent salts was in better agreement with physical models of ion adsorption.

The theoretical descriptions of the present paper are developed more rigorously than those previously published. Their overall agreement with experimental data is good and the resulting membrane parameters are likely to be more closely related to physical membrane properties than those obtained from previous models. The descriptions are useful for membrane process assessment and prediction. They also provide a sound basis for further developments.},

In2O3, using a hybrid density functional theory approach, we assess the impact of the loss of inversion symmetry and the distortion of the oxide sublattice on the electronic and defect
structure. The band structure of the orthorhombic phase retains the key features of a transparent conductive oxide, with a large separation between the fundamental and optical band gaps. The dominant point defect—the oxygen vacancy—shows similar behavior in both

The transport mechanisms were investigated by using three probe molecules: nitrogen, water, and toluene. While a barrier effect appears clearly with nitrogen, this effect changes with the amount of fillers for water and disappears for toluene. The reduction of permeability for nitrogen is mainly due to the increase of tortuosity. For water and toluene, the permeation kinetics reveals many concomitant phenomena responsible for the permeation behavior. Despite the tortuosity effect, the toluene permeability of nanocomposites increases with C30B fraction. The water and toluene molecules interact differently with fillers according to their hydrophilic/hydrophobic character. Moreover, the plasticization effect of water and toluene in the matrix, involving a concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient, is correctly described by the law D = D0eγC. On the basis of Nielsen’s tortuosity concept, we suggest a new approach for relative permeability modeling, not only based on the geometrical parameters (aspect ratio, orientation, recovery) but also including phenomenological parameters deduced from structural characterization and permeation kinetics.},

The phase separation process simulated by this methodology could be close to a real membrane formation process by adopting a linear cooling algorithm based on the macroscopic model results and providing much larger scales. The simulation results indicated that the temperature gradient in the polymer solution resulted from the heat transfer at the polymer solution-coagulation bath interface had a significant influence on the phase separation process, thereby different parts in the polymer solution possessed different cooling rates and coarsen time, which resulted in a microporous membrane with anisotropic structure. Secondly, as the polymer concentration increased, the system became much denser and the phase separation rate got lower due to a decline in the flexibility of the system. The results proved that a further deep understanding could be obtained by this methodology.},

To model ternary mixtures of polar, nonpolar, and amphiphilic molecules, we develop a molecular thermodynamic theory for polydisperse water-in-oil (W/O) droplet-type microemulsions and reverse micelles based on global minimization of the Gibbs free energy of the system. The incorporation of size polydispersity into the theoretical formulation has a significant effect on the Gibbs free energy landscape and allows us to accurately predict micelle size distributions and micelle size variation with composition. Results are presented for two sample ionic surfactant/water/oil systems and compared with experimental data. By predicting the structural and compositional characteristics of w/o microemulsions, the molecular thermodynamic approach provides an important bridge between the modeling of ternary systems at the molecular and the macroscopic level.},

	abstract = {Nanoporous materials are important in industrial separation, but their application is subject to strong interfacial barriers to the entry and transport of fluids. At certain conditions the fluid inside and outside the nanoporous material can be viewed as a two-phase system, with an interface between them, which poses an excess resistance to matter flow. We show that there exist two kinds of phenomena which influence the interfacial resistance: hydrodynamic effects and thermodynamic effects, which are independent of each other. Here, we investigate the role of the thermodynamic effects in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and slit pores and compare the associated thermodynmic resistance with that due to hydrodynamic effects traditionally modeled by the established Sampson expression. Using CH4 and CO2 as model fluids, we show that the thermodynamic resistance is especially important for moderate to high pressures, at which the fluid within the CNT or slit pore is in the condensed state. Further, we show that at such pressures the thermodynamic resistance becomes comparable with the internal resistance to fluid transport at length scales typical of membranes used in fuel cells, and of importance in membrane-based separation, and nanofluidics in general.},

To better understand the current-voltage (I-V) dependence of ion channels, here we describe and prove a collective diffusion model that quantitatively relates the spontaneous ion permeation at equilibrium to the stationary ionic fluxes driven by small voltages. The model makes it possible to determine the channel conductance in the linear I-V range from equilibrium simulations without the application of a voltage. To validate the theory, we perform molecular-dynamics simulations on two channels-a conical-shaped nanopore and the transmembrane pore of an α-hemolysin-under both equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. The simulations reveal substantial couplings between the motions of cations and anions, which are effectively captured by the collective coordinate in the model. Although the two channels exhibit very different linear ranges in the I-V curves, in both cases the channel conductance at small voltages is in reasonable agreement with the prediction from the equilibrium simulation. The simulations also suggest that channel charges, rather than geometric asymmetry, play a more prominent role in current rectification.},

	abstract = {The role of the bonded (bond stretching and bond angle) force-field terms in free energy simulations is examined. It is shown that the proper treatment of such terms depends on the choice of the free energy methodology (single or dual topology). Furthermore, while there are no problems in describing changes in bonded terms, care has to be used in creating or destroying them in a molecular dynamics simulation. An approach that avoids the singularity caused by a bond with a zero force constant is outlined. Changes in bond stretching or bond angle terms are shown to give rise to vibrational, Jacobian factor, and potential-of-mean-force-type (pmf) contributions. The meaning of bond stretching and bond angle bending free energy components obtained in single and dual topology simulations and their connection to these three contributions is investigated. Due to the different end states used in single and dual topology simulations, the pmf contribution is projected on different free energy components. In certain dual topology methods, vibrational and Jacobian factor contributions are not included in the free energy difference. Therefore, single free energy differences (e.g., the free energy difference between two molecules in the gas phase and in solution) often cannot be compared directly between single and dual topology methods. However, identical double free energy differences (e.g., free energy differences of solvation) are obtained in all cases. The present analysis emphasizes the importance of the details of the simulation methodology in interpreting the results for bonded terms and reconciles apparently contradictory findings in the literature.},

The solubility was determined for the commercially available form (FI) from 293.15 K to 318.15 K by the gravimetric method. The influence of solvents on crystal habit and polymorphic form has been investigated. Three different crystal habits of danthron were obtained from slow evaporation and cooling experiments. By evaporation, thin squares of FI were obtained from n-butanol and toluene solutions while both FI and fine needles of FII were obtained from acetone and acetonitrile solutions. In addition, needle-shaped solvate crystals were obtained from acetic acid solutions and the structure of the solvate was solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction. From cooling crystallization experiments, mixtures of FI and FII were often obtained from various solvents, but FI and FII possess distinct habits which can be easily distinguished by visual comparison. Slurry conversion experiments have established that FI is the thermodynamically stable polymorph of danthron at ambient conditions. Differntial scanning calorimetry (DSC) and high-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) have shown that both FI and FII will transform into a high-temperature form (FIV) around 435 K to 439 K before this form melts at 468.5 K. FI, FII, and FIV have been characterized by transmission and high-temperature PXRD, scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectrometry, Raman spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis, and DSC. The solubility of danthron FI in the pure organic solvents of the present work and in the temperature range investigated is below 4.3 \% by weight and decreases in the order toluene, acetone, acetonitrile, and n-butanol.},

	abstract = {Reverse osmosis (RO) is currently the most important desalination technology and it is experiencing significant growth. The objective of this paper is to review the historical and current development of RO membrane materials which are the key determinants of separation performance and water productivity, and hence to define performance targets for those who are developing new RO membrane materials. The chemistry, synthesis mechanism(s) and desalination performance of various RO membranes are discussed from the point of view of membrane materials science. The review starts with the first generation of asymmetric polymeric membranes and finishes with current proposals for nano-structured membrane materials. The paper provides an overview of RO performance in relation to membrane materials and methods of synthesis.

To date polymeric membranes have dominated the RO desalination industry. From the late 1950s to the 1980s the research effort focussed on the search for optimum polymeric membrane materials. In subsequent decades the performance of RO membranes has been optimised via control of membrane formation reactions, and the use of poly-condensation catalysts and additives. The performance of state-of-the-art RO membranes has been highlighted. Nevertheless, the advances in membrane permselectivity in the past decade has been relatively slow, and membrane fouling remains a severe problem.

The emergence of nano-technology in membrane materials science could offer an attractive alternative to polymeric materials. Hence nano-structured membranes are discussed in this review including zeolite membranes, thin film nano-composite membranes, carbon nano-tube membranes, and biomimetic membranes. It is proposed that these novel materials represent the most likely opportunities for enhanced RO desalination performance in the future, but that a number of challenges remain with regard to their practical implementation.},

	abstract = {The dynamic equilibrium model for a bulk nanobubble partly covered with hydrophobic material in water is theoretically and numerically studied. The gas diffusion into a bubble near the peripheral edge of the hydrophobic material on the bubble surface balances that out of the bubble from the other part of the uncovered bubble surface. In the present model, gas diffusion in quiescent liquid is assumed and there is no liquid flow. The total changes of energy and entropy are both zero as it is a kind of equilibrium state. The main origin of the dynamic equilibrium state is the gradient of chemical potential of gas near the peripheral edge of the hydrophobic material. It is caused by the permanent attractive potential of a hydrophobic material to gas molecules dissolved in liquid water as there is permanent repulsion of a hydrophobic material against liquid water. Thus, the gas supply will not terminate. It is numerically shown that stable nanobubble could be present when the fraction of surface coverage by hydrophobic material is from about 0.5 to 1. The stable size of a nanobubble changes with the liquid temperature as well as the degree of gas saturation of water. In slightly degassed water, not only a nanobubble but also a microbubble could be stable in mass balance when the fraction of surface coverage for a microbubble is on the order of 10?4 or less. For hydrophilic materials, however, a bubble could not be stable unless the fraction of the surface coverage is exactly 1. It is suggested that in many experiments of bulk nanobubbles there could be aggregates of nanobubbles.},

	abstract = {A critical assessment of previous theoretical descriptions of membrane nanofiltration shows that the good agreement with experimental data is due to the use of the ratio of effective membrane thickness to membrane porosity as an arbitrary fitting parameter. A more rigorous analysis shows that rejection is independent of membrane thickness.
A model allowing calculation of uncharged solute rejection on the basis of a single membrane parameter (pore radius) is developed. The theoretical description is based on a hydrodynamic model of hindered solute transport in pores. The dependence of solute chemical potential on pressure is included, although its effect is shown to be small. A variation of solvent viscosity with pore radius is also included. For pores of a single size, such variation has no effect on rejection, though it will become important for overall membrane rejection if a pore size distribution is included. The good agreement between this model and experimental data confirms that uncharged solute rejection in nanofiltration membranes may be well-described by such a continuum model.
A two-parameter model (pore radius and membrane charge) for electrolyte rejection has been developed that includes dielectric exclusion in the form of an energy barrier to ion partitioning into the pores. Reassessment of the pore dielectric constant using NaCl rejection at the isoelectric point of a Desal-DK membrane resulted in significantly better agreement with experimental rejection data than use of the high frequency solvent dielectric constant for an oriented layer of water molecules at the pore walls. The predicted values of effective membrane charge density were not only significantly reduced in magnitude, and hence more realistic, than those from previous models, but their variation with concentration for divalent salts was in better agreement with physical models of ion adsorption.
The theoretical descriptions of the present paper are developed more rigorously than those previously published. Their overall agreement with experimental data is good and the resulting membrane parameters are likely to be more closely related to physical membrane properties than those obtained from previous models. The descriptions are useful for membrane process assessment and prediction. They also provide a sound basis for further developments.},

	abstract = {, The hydration of the alkali metal ions in aqueous solution
has been studied by large angle X-ray scattering (LAXS) and double
difference infrared spectroscopy (DDIR). The structures of the dimethyl
sulfoxide solvated alkali metal ions in solution have been determined
to support the studies in aqueous solution. The results of the LAXS
and DDIR measurements show that the sodium, potassium, rubidium and
cesium ions all are weakly hydrated with only a single shell of water
molecules. The smaller lithium ion is more strongly hydrated, most
probably with a second hydration shell present. The influence of the
rubidium and cesium ions on the water structure was found to be very
weak, and it was not possible to quantify this effect in a reliable
way due to insufficient separation of the O–D stretching bands
of partially deuterated water bound to these metal ions and the O–D
stretching bands of the bulk water. Aqueous solutions of sodium, potassium
and cesium iodide and cesium and lithium hydroxide have been studied
by LAXS and M–O bond distances have been determined fairly
accurately except for lithium. However, the number of water molecules
binding to the alkali metal ions is very difficult to determine from
the LAXS measurements as the number of distances and the temperature
factor are strongly correlated. A thorough analysis of M–O
bond distances in solid alkali metal compounds with ligands binding
through oxygen has been made from available structure databases. There
is relatively strong correlation between M–O bond distances
and coordination numbers also for the alkali metal ions even though
the M–O interactions are weak and the number of complexes of
potassium, rubidium and cesium with well-defined coordination geometry
is very small. The mean M–O bond distance in the hydrated sodium,
potassium, rubidium and cesium ions in aqueous solution have been
determined to be 2.43(2), 2.81(1), 2.98(1) and 3.07(1) Å, which
corresponds to six-, seven-, eight- and eight-coordination. These
coordination numbers are supported by the linear relationship of the
hydration enthalpies and the M–O bond distances. This correlation
indicates that the hydrated lithium ion is four-coordinate in aqueous
solution. New ionic radii are proposed for four- and six-coordinate
lithium(I), 0.60 and 0.79 Å, respectively, as well as for five-
and six-coordinate sodium(I), 1.02 and 1.07 Å, respectively.
The ionic radii for six- and seven-coordinate K+, 1.38
and 1.46 Å, respectively, and eight-coordinate Rb+ and Cs+, 1.64 and 1.73 Å, respectively, are confirmed
from previous studies. The M–O bond distances in dimethyl sulfoxide
solvated sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium ions in solution are
very similar to those observed in aqueous solution., The hydration of alkali metal ions has been studied by large angle
X-ray scattering, LAXS, and double difference infrared spectroscopy.
The obtained M−O bond distances from LAXS have been compared
to relevant crystal structures, conclusions about hydration numbers
in aqueous solution have been made, and new ionic radii have been
proposed. Hydration numbers of six, seven, eight and eight are proposed
for the sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium ions in aqueous solution.},

	abstract = {The progress of smart skin technology presents unprecedented opportunities for artificial intelligence. Resolution enhancement and energy conservation are critical to improve the perception and standby time of robots. Here, we present a self-powered analogue smart skin for detecting contact location and velocity of the object, based on a single-electrode contact electrification effect and planar electrostatic induction. Using an analogue localizing method, the resolution of this two-dimensional smart skin can be achieved at 1.9 mm with only four terminals, which notably decreases the terminal number of smart skins. The sensitivity of this smart skin is remarkable, which can even perceive the perturbation of a honey bee. Meanwhile, benefiting from the triboelectric mechanism, extra power supply is unnecessary for this smart skin. Therefore, it solves the problems of batteries and connecting wires for smart skins. With microstructured poly(dimethylsiloxane) films and silver nanowire electrodes, it can be covered on the skin with transparency, flexibility, and high sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have proven efficacy against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, in the setting of incomplete viral suppression, efavirenz and nevirapine select for resistant viruses. The diarylpyrimidine etravirine has demonstrated durable efficacy for patients infected with NNRTI-resistant HIV-1. A screening strategy used to test NNRTI candidates from the same series as etravirine identified TMC278 (rilpivirine). TMC278 is an NNRTI showing subnanomolar 50\% effective concentrations (EC50 values) against wild-type HIV-1 group M isolates (0.07 to 1.01 nM) and nanomolar EC50 values against group O isolates (2.88 to 8.45 nM). Sensitivity to TMC278 was not affected by the presence of most single NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), including those at positions 100, 103, 106, 138, 179, 188, 190, 221, 230, and 236. The HIV-1 site-directed mutant with Y181C was sensitive to TMC278, whereas that with K101P or Y181I/V was resistant. In vitro, considerable cross-resistance between TMC278 and etravirine was observed. Sensitivity to TMC278 was observed for 62\% of efavirenz- and/or nevirapine-resistant HIV-1 recombinant clinical isolates. TMC278 inhibited viral replication at concentrations at which first-generation NNRTIs could not suppress replication. The rates of selection of TMC278-resistant strains were comparable among HIV-1 group M subtypes. NNRTI RAMs emerging in HIV-1 under selective pressure from TMC278 included combinations of V90I, L100I, K101E, V106A/I, V108I, E138G/K/Q/R, V179F/I, Y181C/I, V189I, G190E, H221Y, F227C, and M230I/L. E138R was identified as a new NNRTI RAM. These in vitro analyses demonstrate that TMC278 is a potent next-generation NNRTI, with a high genetic barrier to resistance development.},

Structural properties are in very good agreement with x-ray scattering intensities at temperatures between 0 and 77 degrees C and dynamical properties such as self-diffusion coefficient are in excellent agreement with experiment. The parameterization approach used can be easily generalized to rehabilitate any water force field using available experimental data over a range of thermodynamic points.},

Using molecular dynamics simulations we investigate water flow in (16,16) CNTs and show that the enhanced flow rates over Hagen-Poiseuille flow arise from a velocity "jump" in a depletion region at the water nanotube interface and that the water orientations and hydrogen bonding at the interface significantly affect the flow rates. For nanotube with the same smooth wall structure but with more hydrophilic Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters of silicon, the enhancement is greatly reduced because it does not have "free" OH bonds pointing to the wall as in CNTs that would reduce the number of hydrogen bonds in the depletion layer. Roughness in the tube walls causes strong hydrogen-bonding network and no significant flow enhancement is attained in rough tubes.},

	abstract = {The suitability of a hybrid density functional to qualitatively reproduce geometric and energetic details of parallel π-stacked aromatic complexes is presented. The hybrid functional includes an ad hoc mixture of half the exact (HF) exchange with half of the uniform electron gas exchange, plus Lee, Yang, and Parr's expression for correlation energy. This functional, in combination with polarized, diffuse basis sets, gives a binding energy for the parallel-displaced benzene dimer in good agreement with the best available high-level calculations reported in the literature, and qualitatively reproduces the local MP2 potential energy surface of the parallel-displaced benzene dimer. This method was further critically compared to high-level calculations recently reported in the literature for a range of π-stacked complexes, including monosubstituted benzene–benzene dimers, along with DNA and RNA bases, and generally agrees with MP2 and/or CCSD(T) results to within ±2 kJ mol−1. We also show that the resulting BH\&H binding energy is closely related to the electron density in the intermolecular region. The net result is that the BH\&H functional, presumably due to fortuitous cancellation of errors, provides a pragmatic, computationally efficient quantum mechanical tool for the study of large π-stacked systems such as DNA. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The thermal property, density, self-diffusion coefficient of the anions and cations, viscosity, and ionic conductivity were measured for these ionic liquids in wide temperature ranges. A pulsed-gradient spin−echo NMR method was used to independently measure self-diffusion coefficients of the anions (19F NMR) and the cations (1H NMR). The results indicate that the cations diffuse almost equally to the anion in EMIBF4 and BPBF4, whereas they diffuse faster than the anion in EMITFSI and BPTFSI. The summation of the cationic and anionic diffusion coefficients for each ionic liquid follows the order EMITFSI {\textgreater} EMIBF4 {\textgreater} BPTFSI {\textgreater} BPBF4, under an isothermal condition. The order of the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient well contrasts with that of the viscosity for each ionic liquid. The temperature dependencies of the self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and ionic conductivity obey the Vogel−Tamman−Fulcher (VTF) equation, and the VTF parameters were presented. Relationships among the self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and molar conductivity were analyzed in terms of the Stokes−Einstein equation and the Nernst−Einstein equation. The most interesting feature of the relationships is that the ratios of the molar conductivity, determined by complex impedance measurements, to that calculated from the NMR diffusion coefficients, range from 0.6 to 0.8 for EMIBF4 and BPBF4, whereas the ratios range from 0.3 to 0.5 for EMITFSI and BPTFSI. This difference could be understood by taking the ionic association into consideration for EMITFSI and BPTFSI.},

	abstract = {We computed the transport of methane through 1 nm wide slit-shaped pores carved out of solid substrates. Models for silica, magnesium oxide, and alumina were used as solid substrates. The pores were filled with water. The results show that the methane permeability through the hydrated pores is strongly dependent on the solid substrate. Detailed analysis of the simulated systems reveals that local properties of confined water, including its structure, and more importantly, evolution of solvation free energy and hydrogen bond structure are responsible for the pronounced differences observed. The simulations are extended to multicomponent systems representative of natural gas, containing methane, ethane, and H2S. The results show that all pores considered have high affinity for H2S, moderate affinity for methane, and low affinity for ethane. The H2S/methane transport selectivity through the hydrated alumina pore is comparable, or superior, to that reported for existing commercial membranes. A multiscale approach was then implemented to demonstrate that a Smoluchowski one-dimensional model is able to reproduce the molecular-level results for short pores when appropriate values for the local self-diffusion coefficients are used as input parameters. We propose that the model can be extended to predict methane transport through uniform hydrated pores of macroscopic length. When verified by experiments, our simulation results could have important implications in applications such as natural gas sweetening and predictions of methane migration through hydraulically fractured shale formations.},

MD simulations using a quantum-chemistry-based many-body polarizable force field yielded ion self-diffusion coefficients, electrolyte conductivity, ion aggregation, and the coordination environment of Li+ in good agreement with experiment. Lithium transport was found to arise from a combination of the subdiffusive Li+ motion along PEO chains, motion together with PEO segments and intersegmental Li+ hops from one PEO segment to another. The rate of intersegmental hops was found to correlate well with times at which Li+ motion crosses over from subdiffusive to diffusive behavior. The contribution of Li+ motion along PEO chains to the total Li+ transport was found to be approximately equal to the contribution from Li+ moving together with PEO segments. Diffusion of both Li+ and TFSI- was found to be strongly coupled to PEO ether oxygen atom displacements and PEO conformational dynamics.},

	abstract = {The recently developed lambda-dynamics free-energy based simulation method was used to study the binding of 10 five-member ring heterocycle derivatives to an artificial cavity created by mutagenesis inside cytochrome c peroxidase. Application of lambda-dynamics to this system gives a reasonable estimate of the binding affinity of the ligands. This methodology also provides a means to explore the binding orientations and conformations of the ligands inside the binding pocket much better than does conventional MD. This is due to the scaling of forces inherent in the it-dynamics method, which lowers the barriers separating different binding modes and conformations. Examination of the lambda-dynamics trajectory of the ligands revealed alternative binding orientations and conformations not detected by crystallography. Furthermore, a lambda-dynamics simulation starting from random initial orientations, in which some li,ligands take significantly different orientations as compared with those from the X-ray structure, successfully samples the X-ray crystallographic orientations in all ligands. Ligand sampling by conventional MD starting from same initial structures remains trapped in the local minima from which they start. Such efficient sampling of ligand orientations and conformations is expected to diminish the limitation that an initial ligand structure must be close to its true bound orientation in order to yield a reasonable estimate of the binding free energy.},

	abstract = {Nanostructured free-standing films were obtained by polymerisation of lyotropic liquid crystal phases based on the monomer 3,4,5-tris(11′-acryloyloxyundecyloxy)benzoate. The structure of these films was investigated by X-ray diffraction. No change of the lattice due to the polymerisation procedure was observed. The low water content (below 10 wt.-\%) of the liquid crystals in combination with the observed hexagonal lattice reveal that a reversed hexagonal structure (H2 phase) is present. Different types of films were investigated, obtained by varying the preparation conditions of the used lyotropic liquid crystals, such as water content, type of metal-counterion and length of the monomer. The lattice constant was found to be independent of the water content. It seems that at low water content of 8 wt.-\% the lyotropic structure is still fully hydrated. This unusual behaviour is related to the tapered structure of the monomer which is composed of by a small headgroup and three extended tails for each headgroup. The lattice constant can be changed by using differently charged metal-counterions which are associated with the headgroup, as well as by varying the length of the tails on the monomer. Low resolution electron density maps of the hexagonal lattice give deeper insight in the arrangement of the monomers within the polymerised structure.},

The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},

The crystal structure corresponding to the global minimum has not been observed experimentally, but analysis of the crystal structures of similar molecules in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) indicates that the packing motif present in the predicted structure is also found in nature. To date it has not been experimentally possible to crystallize the most stable polymorph of the biologically active R-enantiomer, whereas the S-enantiomer readily crystallizes in the stable form. Analysis of the results shows that this polymorph has an uncommon packing motif which is found just once among the 12 lowest energy predicted structures but is seen in two crystal structures of MA-like molecules whose structures are stored in the CSD. On the basis of the calculations and comparisons with experimental crystal structures, suggestions are made as to possible routes for crystallizing the, as yet unknown, polymorph of MA, which corresponds to the predicted structure with the lowest lattice energy.},

	abstract = {The \${\textbackslash}backslash\$lambda-dynamics simulation method was used to study the binding of 10 five-member ring heterocycle derivatives to an artificial cavity created inside cytochrome C peroxidase by mutagenesis. Application of dynamics using a multiple topology approach resulted in trapping in local minima. To extend the method to these cases, a new restraining potential was devised and added to the extended Hamiltonian. Two approximations were introduced in order to estimate the binding free energy within small simulation times using this potential: (a) The entropy terms related to the restraining potential are assumed to cancel, due to the similarity of the ligands. (b) The restraining potential calculated from the coordinates of the environmental atoms during a -dynamics simulation is assumed to be equal to that of the average coordinates. Relatively short -dynamics simulations with this restraining potential successfully yielded reasonable estimates of the binding affinity of the ligands as compared with both experimental data and free energy perturbation calculations. Long time -dynamics simulations with a ten-ligand system revealed that better ligands tend to have small statistical errors, which is appropriate for screening out the plausible ligands from all candidates. Furthermore, short time -dynamics simulations with ten identical ligands demonstrated that sufficient precision was achieved for putative discovery of tight binding ligands or guests.},

	abstract = {Diffusion in one dimensional rugged energy landscape (REL) is predicted to be pathologically different (from any higher dimension) with a much larger chance of encountering broken ergodicity [D. L. Stein and C. M. Newman, AIP Conf. Proc. 1479, 620 (2012)]. However, no quantitative study of this difference has been reported, despite the prevalence of multidimensional physical models in the literature (like a high dimensional funnel guiding protein folding/unfolding). Paradoxically, some theoretical studies of these phenomena still employ a one dimensional diffusion description for analytical tractability. We explore the dimensionality dependent diffusion on REL by carrying out an effective medium approximation based analytical calculations and compare them with the available computer simulation results. We find that at an intermediate level of ruggedness (assumed to have a Gaussian distribution), where diffusion is well-defined, the value of the effective diffusion coefficient depends on dimensionality and changes (increases) by several factors (∼5-10) in going from 1d to 2d. In contrast, the changes in subsequent transitions (like 2d to 3d and 3d to 4d and so on) are far more modest, of the order of 10-20\% only. When ruggedness is given by random traps with an exponential distribution of barrier heights, the mean square displacement (MSD) is sub-diffusive (a well-known result), but the growth of MSD is described by different exponents in one and higher dimensions. The reason for such strong ruggedness induced retardation in the case of one dimensional REL is discussed. We also discuss the special limiting case of infinite dimension (d = ∞) where the effective medium approximation becomes exact and where theoretical results become simple. We discuss, for the first time, the role of spatial correlation in the landscape on diffusion of a random walker.},

An organic rejection of 96.5\% with a water flux of 0.33 kg m−2 h−1 was obtained for 100 ppm pentanoic acid solution at an operation pressure of 2.76 MPa. For non-electrolyte organics, separation efficiency is governed by the molecular dynamic size; the organics with larger molecular dynamic size show higher separation efficiency. The zeolite membrane gives an organic rejection of 99.5\% and 17\% for 100 ppm toluene and 100 ppm ethanol, respectively, with a water flux of 0.03 kg m−2 h−1, 0.31 kg m−2 h−1 at an operation pressure of 2.76 MPa.

	abstract = {This article reports on the calibration and validation of a new GROMOS-compatible parameter set 2016H66 for small organic molecules in the condensed phase. The calibration is based on 62 organic molecules spanning the chemical functions alcohol, ether, aldehyde, ketone, carboxylic acid, ester, amine, amide, thiol, sulfide, and disulfide, as well as aromatic compounds and nucleic-acid bases. For 57 organic compounds, the calibration targets are the experimental pure-liquid density ρliq and the vaporization enthalpy ΔHvap, as well as the hydration free energy ΔGwat and the solvation free energy ΔGche in cyclohexane, at atmospheric pressure and at (or close to) room temperature. The final root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) for these four quantities over the set of compounds are 32.4 kg m–3, 3.5 kJ mol–1, 4.1 kJ mol–1, and 2.1 kJ mol–1, respectively, and the corresponding average deviations (AVED) are 1.0 kg m–3, 0.2 kJ mol–1, 2.6 kJ mol–1, and 1.0 kJ mol–1, respectively. For the five nucleic-acid bases, the parametrization is performed by transferring the final 2016H66 parameters from analogous organic compounds followed by a slight readjustment of the charges to reproduce the experimental water-to-chloroform transfer free energies ΔGtrn. The final RMSD for this quantity over the five bases is 1.7 kJ mol–1, and the corresponding AVED is 0.8 kJ mol–1. As an initial validation of the 2016H66 set, seven additional thermodynamic, transport, and dielectric properties are calculated for the 57 organic compounds in the liquid phase. The agreement with experiment in terms of these additional properties is found to be reasonable, with significant deviations typically affecting either a specific chemical function or a specific molecule. This suggests that in most cases, a classical force-field description along with a careful parametrization against ρliq, ΔHvap, ΔGwat, and ΔGche results in a model that appropriately describes the liquid in terms of a wide spectrum of its physical properties.},

	abstract = {The shortage of available fresh water is one of the global issues presently faced by humanity. To determine a solution to this problem, the survival strategies of plants have been examined. In this study, a nature-inspired membrane with a highly charged surface is proposed as an effective membrane for the filtration of saline water. To mimic the desalination characteristics of mangrove roots, a macroporous membrane based on polyethylene terephthalate is treated with polyelectrolytes using a layer-by-layer deposition method. The fabricated membrane surface has a highly negative charged ζ-potential value of −97.5 ± 4.3 mV, similar to that of the first layer of mangrove roots. Desalination of saline water using this membrane shows a high salt retention rate of 96.5\%. The highly charged surface of the membrane may induce a relatively thick and stable ion depletion zone in front of the membrane. As a result, most co-ions are repelled from the membrane surface, and counterions are also rejected by virtue of their electroneutrality. The water permeability is found to be 7.60–7.69 L/m2·h, which is 10 times higher than that of the reverse osmosis desalination method. This nature-inspired filtration membrane exhibits steady desalination performance over 72 h of operation, successfully demonstrating the stable filtration of saline water. This nature-inspired membrane is applicable to the design of a small-scale, portable, and energy-free desalination device for use in third-world countries or small villages.},

	abstract = {Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) is a polyphenolic active compound present in popular apiproduct, “propolis”, obtained from beehives. Though it has broad therapeutic capability, the bioavailability of CAPE is limited due to poor solubility. In this study, we report novel cocrystals of CAPE engineered using coformers such as caffeine (CAF), isonicotinamide (INIC), and nicotinamide (NIC) with enhanced solubility and bioavailability of CAPE. The cocrystals were prepared by microwave-assisted cocrystallization and characterized using PXRD, DSC, and Raman spectroscopy. PXRD and DSC confirm the successful formation and phase purity of CAPE-CAF, CAPE-INIC, and CAPE-NIC cocrystals. Raman spectra of CAPE cocrystals complement these results in confirming the formation of novel crystalline phases. CAPE-NIC cocrystal was further subjected to X-ray crystallography to understand its molecular arrangement and hydrogen bonding in the crystal structure. The CAPE-NIC cocrystal structure is found to be stabilized by a rare 1,2-benzenediol-amide heterosynthon. Cocrystallization of CAPE with NIC improved its aqueous solubility and pharmacokinetic profile, thereby demonstrating a 2.76-fold escalation in bioavailability.},

	abstract = {The innate immune system guards against virus infection through a variety of mechanisms including mobilization of the host interferon system, which attacks viral products mainly at a posttranscriptional level. The influenza virus NS1 protein is a multifunctional facilitator of virus replication, one of whose actions is to antagonize the interferon response. Since NS1 is required for efficient virus replication, it was reasoned that chemical inhibitors of this protein could be used to further understand virus-host interactions and also serve as potential new antiviral agents. A yeast-based assay was developed to identify compounds that phenotypically suppress NS1 function. Several such compounds exhibited significant activity specifically against influenza A virus in cell culture but had no effect on the replication of another RNA virus, respiratory syncytial virus. Interestingly, cells lacking an interferon response were drug resistant, suggesting that the compounds block interactions between NS1 and the interferon system. Accordingly, the compounds reversed the inhibition of beta interferon mRNA induction during infection, which is known to be caused by NS1. In addition, the compounds blocked the ability of NS1 protein to inhibit double-stranded RNA-dependent activation of a transfected beta interferon promoter construct. The effects of the compounds were specific to NS1, because they had no effect on the ability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus papainlike protease protein to block beta interferon promoter activation. These data demonstrate that the function of NS1 can be modulated by chemical inhibitors and that such inhibitors will be useful as probes of biological function and as starting points for clinical drug development.},

	doi = {10.1006/jmbi.2000.4285},
	abstract = {Specific amino acid binding by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRS) is necessary for correct translation of the genetic code. Engineering a modified specificity into aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases has been proposed as a means to incorporate artificial amino acid residues into proteins in vivo. In a previous paper, the binding to aspartyl-tRNA synthetase of the substrate Asp and the analogue Asn were compared by molecular dynamics free energy simulations. Molecular dynamics combined with Poisson-Boltzmann free energy calculations represent a less expensive approach, suitable for examining multiple active site mutations in an engineering effort. Here, Poisson-Boltzmann free energy calculations for aspartyl-tRNA synthetase are first validated by their ability to reproduce selected molecular dynamics binding free energy differences, then used to examine the possibility of Asn binding to native and mutant aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. A component analysis of the Poisson-Boltzmann free energies is employed to identify specific interactions that determine the binding affinities. The combined use of molecular dynamics free energy simulations to study one binding process thoroughly, followed by molecular dynamics and Poisson-Boltzmann free energy calculations to study a series of related ligands or mutations is proposed as a paradigm for protein or ligand design. The binding of Asn in an alternate, "head-to-tail" orientation observed in the homologous asparagine synthetase is analyzed, and found to be more stable than the "Asp-like" orientation studied earlier. The new orientation is probably unsuitable for catalysis. A conserved active site lysine (Lys198 in Escherichia coli) that recognizes the Asp side-chain is changed to a leucine residue, found at the corresponding position in asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase. It is interesting that the binding of Asp is calculated to increase slightly (rather than to decrease), while that of Asn is calculated, as expected, to increase strongly, to the same level as Asp binding. Insight into the origin of these changes is provided by the component analyses. The double mutation (K198L,D233E) has a similar effect, while the triple mutation (K198L,Q199E,D233E) reduces Asp binding strongly. No binding measurements are available, but the three mutants are known to have no ability to adenylate Asn, despite the "Asp-like" binding affinities calculated here. In molecular dynamics simulations of all three mutants, the Asn ligand backbone shifts by 1-2 A compared to the experimental Asp:AspRS complex, and significant side-chain rearrangements occur around the pocket. These could reduce the ATP binding constant and/or the adenylation reaction rate, explaining the lack of catalytic activity in these complexes. Finally, Asn binding to AspRS with neutral K198 or charged H449 is considered, and shown to be less favorable than with the charged K198 and neutral H449 used in the analysis.},

Much effort has been devoted to achieving extremely high performance on both workstations and parallel computers. The design includes an extraction of virial and periodic boundary conditions from the loops over pairwise interactions, and special software routines to enable rapid calculation of x–1/2. Inner loops are generated automatically in C or Fortran at compile time, with optimizations adapted to each architecture. Assembly loops using SSE and 3DNow! Multimedia instructions are provided for x86 processors, resulting in exceptional performance on inexpensive PC workstations. The interface is simple and easy to use (no scripting language), based on standard command line arguments with self-explanatory functionality and integrated documentation. All binary files are independent of hardware endian and can be read by versions of GROMACS compiled using different floating-point precision. A large collection of flexible tools for trajectory analysis is included, with output in the form of finished Xmgr/Grace graphs. A basic trajectory viewer is included, and several external visualization tools can read the GROMACS trajectory format.

The hybrid functional includes an ad hoc mixture of half the exact (HF) exchange with half of the uniform electron gas exchange, plus Lee, Yang, and Parr's expression for correlation energy. This functional, in combination with polarized, diffuse basis sets, gives a binding energy for the parallel-displaced benzene dimer in good agreement with the best available high-level calculations reported in the literature, and qualitatively reproduces the local MP2 potential energy surface of the parallel-displaced benzene dimer. This method was further critically compared to high-level calculations recently reported in the literature for a range of π-stacked complexes, including monosubstituted benzene–benzene dimers, along with DNA and RNA bases, and generally agrees with MP2 and/or CCSD(T) results to within ±2 kJ mol−1. We also show that the resulting BH\&H binding energy is closely related to the electron density in the intermolecular region. The net result is that the BH\&H functional, presumably due to fortuitous cancellation of errors, provides a pragmatic, computationally efficient quantum mechanical tool for the study of large π-stacked systems such as DNA. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This phenomenon is important for a wide range of applications, from chemomechanical sensors to methane recovery from geological formations.

Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we calculate the surface stresses for the dry α-quartz surfaces, and investigate how these stresses change when the surfaces are exposed to water. We find that the nonhydroxylated surface shows small and approximately isotropic changes in stress, while the hydroxylated surface, which interacts more strongly with the polar water molecules, shows larger and qualitatively anisotropic (opposite sign in xx and yy) surface stress changes. All of these changes are several times larger than the surface tension of water itself. The anisotropy and possibility of positive surface stress change can explain experimentally observed surface area contraction due to adsorption.},

Distillation plants require an inlet seawater flow around 8 to 10 times the fresh water production rate, for cooling and feed make-up.

A seawater RO plant generally requires a lower feedwater flow rate of around 2.5 to 3 times the production. Salinity of the discharge is correspondingly greater than in distillation, but temperature rise is small. Chemical discharges are compared for the different processes. A comparison is made of atmospheric emissions from generating the power to drive RO process pumps and the emissions resulting from generation of steam and auxiliary power for distillation (in dual purpose desalination/power plants). The factors affecting site selection and requirements for seawater intakes and outfalls are briefly discussed, with examples. The land area needed for a desalination plant is compared with the catchment and reservoir areas needed for a typical surface water collection scheme to illustrate the much lower impact of desalination on land resources. Factors such as noise and aesthetics are also briefly discussed.},

	abstract = {In pressure-driven membrane processes (reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration) a pressure exerted on the solution at one side of the membrane serves as a driving force to separate it into a permeate and a retentate. The permeate is usually pure water, whereas the retentate is a concentrated solution that must be disposed of or treated by other methods. Membranes may be polymeric, organo-mineral, ceramic, or metallic, and filtration techniques differ in pore size, from dense (no pores) to porous membranes. Depending on the type of technique, salts, small organic molecules, macromolecules, or particles can be retained, and the applied pressure will differ. This paper reviews the principles behind the different techniques, the types of membranes used, rejection mechanisms, and process modeling. Applications of pressure-driven membrane processes are also considered, including reverse osmosis and nanofiltration for the treatment of wastewater from landfills and composting plants, nanofiltration in the textile industry, and ultrafiltration and microfiltration in drinking water production and wastewater treatment. Lastly, the paper discusses recent developments, including techniques to prevent membrane fouling by modifications affecting surface roughness or hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, or by cleaning the membranes, and methods for treating or disposing of the retentate.},

	abstract = {First, a technique is introduced for computing equilibrium probability distributions for transitional rare-event simulations by combining the ensemble of trajectories generated by forward flux sampling (FFS) and by umbrella sampling (US) in multiple windows along an order parameter of interest; this method is denoted FFS-US. Second, the FFS algorithm is extended to obtain rate constants of partial transitions involving intermediate states from a single simulation; this is denoted “multiple state” FFS. For the FFS-US method, a FFS algorithm (preoptimized for order parameter and staging) is used to take advantage of its zero potential bias of phase-space sampling to gather histogram data with which to jump start the US and get the equilibrium distributions. In this way, kinetic data (like the rate constants and the transition path ensemble) and the underlying free-energy landscape (or probability distribution) of the system are obtained efficiently and concurrently. The applicability of these techniques is illustrated by studying several test systems, including two that involve potential energy surfaces having multiple metastable states and transition pathways, representative of complex kinetic behavior.},

However, basis sets even larger than aug-cc-pVTZ are important for accurate binding energies. The complete basis set MP2 binding energies, estimated by explicitly correlated MP2−R12/A techniques, are significantly larger in magnitude than previous estimates. When corrected for higher-order correlation effects via coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)], the binding energies De (D0) for the sandwich, T-shaped, and parallel-displaced configurations are found to be 1.8 (2.0), 2.7 (2.4), and 2.8 (2.7) kcal mol-1, respectively.},

For this system, using a polarizable Hamiltonian instead of the cheaper point-charge potentials is shown to have a significantly smaller effect on the stability at 250 K than on the lattice energy at 0 K. The benzene I polymorph is found to be the most stable crystal structure in all three potentials examined and at all temperatures examined. For each potential, we report the free energies over a range of temperatures and discuss the added value of using full free energy methods over the minimized lattice energy to determine the relative crystal stability at finite temperatures. The free energies in the polarizable Hamiltonian are efficiently calculated using samples collected in a cheaper point-charge potential. The polarizable free energies are estimated from the point-charge trajectories using Boltzmann reweighting with MBAR. The high configuration-space overlap necessary for efficient Boltzmann reweighting is achieved by designing point-charge potentials with intramolecular parameters matching those in the expensive polarizable Hamiltonian. Finally, we compare the computational cost of this indirect reweighted free energy estimate to the cost of simulating directly in the expensive polarizable Hamiltonian.},

The structure of these films was investigated by X-ray diffraction. No change of the lattice due to the polymerisation procedure was observed. The low water content (below 10 wt.-\%) of the liquid crystals in combination with the observed hexagonal lattice reveal that a reversed hexagonal structure (H2 phase) is present. Different types of films were investigated, obtained by varying the preparation conditions of the used lyotropic liquid crystals, such as water content, type of metal-counterion and length of the monomer. The lattice constant was found to be independent of the water content. It seems that at low water content of 8 wt.-\% the lyotropic structure is still fully hydrated. This unusual behaviour is related to the tapered structure of the monomer which is composed of by a small headgroup and three extended tails for each headgroup. The lattice constant can be changed by using differently charged metal-counterions which are associated with the headgroup, as well as by varying the length of the tails on the monomer. Low resolution electron density maps of the hexagonal lattice give deeper insight in the arrangement of the monomers within the polymerised structure.},

Most drugs exhibit structural polymorphism, and it is preferable to develop the most thermodynamically stable polymorph of the drug to assure reproducible bioavailability of the product over its shelf life under a variety of real-world storage conditions. There are occasional situations in which the development of a metastable crystalline or amorphous form is justified because a medical benefit is achieved. Such situations include those in which a faster dissolution rate or higher concentration are desired, in order to achieve rapid absorption and efficacy, or to achieve acceptable systemic exposure for a low-solubility drug. Another such situation is one in which the drug remains amorphous despite extensive efforts to crystallize it. If there is no particular medical benefit, there is less justification for accepting the risks of intentional development of a metastable crystalline or amorphous form. Whether or not there is medical benefit, the risks associated with development of a metastable form must be mitigated by laboratory work which provides assurance that (a) the largest possible form change will have no substantive effect on product quality or bioavailability, and/or (b) a change will not occur under all reasonable real-world storage conditions, and/or (c) analytical methodology and sampling procedures are in place which assure that a problem will be detected before dosage forms which have compromised quality or bioavailability can reach patients.},

Since the removal of these compounds in water and wastewater treatment applications is of great importance where a high product water quality is desired, an understanding of the factors affecting the permeation of solutes in high-pressure membrane systems is needed. In this paper, findings of a comprehensive literature review are reported, targeting membrane rejection mechanisms and factors affecting rejection. The following key solute parameters were identified to primarily affect solute rejection: molecular weight (MW), molecular size (length and width), acid disassociation constant (pKa), hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity (log Kow), and diffusion coefficient (Dp). Key membrane properties affecting rejection that were identified include molecular weight cut-off, pore size, surface charge (measured as zeta potential), hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity (measured as contact angle), and surface morphology (measured as roughness). In addition, feed water composition, such as pH, ionic strength, hardness, and the presence of organic matter, was also identified as having an influence on solute rejection. From the knowledge gained during the literature review, a rejection diagram was proposed, which qualitatively allows prediction of solute rejection if certain solute and membrane properties are known.},

In this study, we report the generation of lipid nanoparticle libraries with information regarding mesophase and lattice parameter, which can aid the selection of formulation for a particular end-use application. In this study we elucidate the phase composition parameters that influence the internal structure of lipid nanoparticles produced from monoolein, monopalmitolein and phytantriol incorporating a variety of saturated fatty acids (FA) with different chain lengths at varying concentrations and temperatures. The material libraries were established using high throughput formulation and screening techniques, including synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering. The results demonstrate the rich polymorphism of lipid nanoparticles with nonlamellar mesophases in the presence of saturated FAs. The inclusion of saturated FAs within the lipid nanoparticles promotes a gradual phase transition at all temperatures studied toward structures with higher negative surface curvatures (e.g., from inverse bicontinuous cubic phase to hexagonal phase and then emulsified microemulsion). The three partial phase diagrams produced are discussed in terms of the influence of FA chain length and concentration on nanoparticle internal mesophase structure and lattice parameters. The study also highlights a compositionally dependent coexistence of multiple mesophases, which may indicate the presence of multicompartment nanoparticles containing cubic/cubic and cubic/hexagonal mesophases.},

	abstract = {The evolution of antiretroviral drug resistance is a major problem in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Drug therapy failure is associated with accumulation of drug resistance mutations and results in the development of drug resistance. Drugs targeted against reverse transcriptase (RT) as well as drug-resistant RT have been shown to increase HIV-1 mutation frequencies. Furthermore, combinations of drug and drug-resistant RT can increase virus mutation frequencies in a multiplicative manner. The evolution of drug resistance also alters virus fitness. The correlation of increased HIV-1 mutation rates with the evolution of antiretroviral drug resistance indicates that drug failure could increase the likelihood of further resistance evolving from subsequent drug regimens. These observations parallel studies from microbial systems that provide evidence for a correlation between drug resistance development and increased pathogen mutation rates. Although increased mutant frequencies may be detrimental to effective therapy, the lethal mutagenesis of the HIV-1 genome may provide a new means for antiretroviral therapy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

A comparison of free energy components of the single and double free energy differences obtained in the calculations makes it possible to identify the three contributions that the theoretical analysis showed were involved, i.e., vibrational, pmf-type, and Jacobian factor terms.The verification of the theoretical analysis by illustrative examples provides the basis for addressing the question of whether the so-called self-terms can make significant contributions to double free energy differences. This is accomplished by identifying the effect of coupling of the three contributions from bonded energy terms on a double free energy difference. For the model systems studied, coupling and, hence, self-terms are found to be of little importance. The analysis resolves the ambiguities concerning this issue in the literature.},

	abstract = {A virtual screening protocol has been applied to seek non-nucleoside inhibitors of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (NNRTIs) and its K103N mutant. First, a chemical similarity search on the Maybridge library was performed using known NNRTIs as reference structures. The top-ranked molecules obtained from this procedure plus 26 known NNRTIs were then docked into the binding sites of the wild-type reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT) and its K103N variant (K103N-RT) using Glide 3.5. The top-ranked 100 compounds from the docking for both proteins were post-scored with a procedure using molecular mechanics and continuum solvation (MM-GB/SA). The validity of the virtual screening protocol was supported by (i) testing of the MM-GB/SA procedure, (ii) agreement between predicted and crystallographic binding poses, (iii) recovery of known potent NNRTIs at the top of both rankings, and (iv) identification of top-scoring library compounds that are close in structure to recently reported NNRTI HTS hits. However, purchase and assaying of selected top-scoring compounds from the library failed to yield active anti-HIV agents. Nevertheless, the highest-ranked database compound, S10087, was pursued as containing a potentially viable core. Subsequent synthesis and assaying of S10087 analogues proposed by further computational analysis yielded anti-HIV agents with EC50 values as low as 310 nM. Thus, with the aid of computational tools, it was possible to evolve a false positive into a true active.},

	abstract = {Reverse osmosis membrane technology has developed over the past 40 years to a 44\% share in world desalting production capacity, and an 80\% share in the total number of desalination plants installed worldwide. The use of membrane desalination has increased as materials have improved and costs have decreased. Today, reverse osmosis membranes are the leading technology for new desalination installations, and they are applied to a variety of salt water resources using tailored pretreatment and membrane system design. Two distinct branches of reverse osmosis desalination have emerged: seawater reverse osmosis and brackish water reverse osmosis. Differences between the two water sources, including foulants, salinity, waste brine (concentrate) disposal options, and plant location, have created significant differences in process development, implementation, and key technical problems. Pretreatment options are similar for both types of reverse osmosis and depend on the specific components of the water source. Both brackish water and seawater reverse osmosis (RO) will continue to be used worldwide; new technology in energy recovery and renewable energy, as well as innovative plant design, will allow greater use of desalination for inland and rural communities, while providing more affordable water for large coastal cities. A wide variety of research and general information on RO desalination is available; however, a direct comparison of seawater and brackish water RO systems is necessary to highlight similarities and differences in process development. This article brings to light key parameters of an RO process and process modifications due to feed water characteristics.},

	abstract = {Biological pores regulate the cellular traffic of a large variety of solutes, often with high selectivity and fast flow rates. These pores share several common structural features: the inner surface of the pore is frequently lined with hydrophobic residues, and the selectivity filter regions often contain charged functional groups. Hydrophobic, narrow-diameter carbon nanotubes can provide a simplified model of membrane channels by reproducing these critical features in a simpler and more robust platform. Previous studies demonstrated that carbon nanotube pores can support a water flux comparable to natural aquaporin channels. Here, we investigate ion transport through these pores using a sub-2-nm, aligned carbon nanotube membrane nanofluidic platform. To mimic the charged groups at the selectivity region, we introduce negatively charged groups at the opening of the carbon nanotubes by plasma treatment. Pressure-driven filtration experiments, coupled with capillary electrophoresis analysis of the permeate and feed, are used to quantify ion exclusion in these membranes as a function of solution ionic strength, pH, and ion valence. We show that carbon nanotube membranes exhibit significant ion exclusion that can be as high as 98\% under certain conditions. Our results strongly support a Donnan-type rejection mechanism, dominated by electrostatic interactions between fixed membrane charges and mobile ions, whereas steric and hydrodynamic effects appear to be less important.},

Increased insight into their functional mechanisms is crucial to enable drug design on this important class of membrane proteins, and to enhance our understanding of some of the fundamental features of cells. This review presents the concepts behind the recently developed simulation protocol Computational Electrophysiology (CompEL), which facilitates the atomistic simulation of ion channels in action. In addition, the review provides guidelines for its application in conjunction with the molecular dynamics software package GROMACS. We first lay out the rationale for designing CompEL as a method that models the driving force for ion permeation through channels the way it is established in cells, i.e., by electrochemical ion gradients across the membrane. This is followed by an outline of its implementation and a description of key settings and parameters helpful to users wishing to set up and conduct such simulations. In recent years, key mechanistic and biophysical insights have been obtained by employing the CompEL protocol to address a wide range of questions on ion channels and permeation. We summarize these recent findings on membrane proteins, which span a spectrum from highly ion-selective, narrow channels to wide diffusion pores. Finally we discuss the future potential of CompEL in light of its limitations and strengths. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane Proteins edited by J.C.

Thousands of MOFs have been reported to date. However, membrane performance of only a small number of MOFs has been experimentally reported since fabrication of thin-film MOF membranes is challenging. In this study, we used atomically-detailed simulations to assess membrane-based CH4/H2 separation performances of 172 different MOF structures. Adsorption selectivity, diffusion selectivity, membrane selectivity and gas permeability of MOFs were calculated using atomically-detailed simulations to identify the most promising membrane materials. Our results show that a significant number of MOF membranes exhibits high CH4 selectivity over H2 and a small number of MOF membranes exhibits mediocre H2 selectivity over CH4. Gas permeabilities and selectivities of MOF membranes were compared with traditional membranes such as polymers and zeolites. Several MOFs were identified to exceed the upper bound established for polymeric membranes and many MOF membranes showed higher gas permeabilities and selectivities than zeolites LTA, ITQ-29 and MFI. We also carried out flexible molecular dynamics simulations to examine the effect of MOF's flexibility on the predicted membrane performance. Considering flexibility of the framework made a negligible effect on the gas permeability and selectivity of the material having large pores whereas more pronounced changes were seen in gas permeabilities of the material having narrow pores. The results of this computational study will be helpful to guide the experiments to the most promising MOF membranes for CH4/H2 separations.},

Soc. 1992, 114, 5729), electron-withdrawing substituents enhance binding in the benzene dimer by withdrawing electron density from the π-cloud of the substituted ring, reducing the repulsive electrostatic interaction with the nonsubstituted benzene. Conversely, electron-donating substituents donate excess electrons into the π-system and diminish the π-stacking interaction. We present computed interaction energies for the sandwich configuration of the benzene dimer and 24 substituted dimers, as well as sandwich complexes of substituted benzenes with perfluorobenzene. While the computed interaction energies correlate well with σm values for the substituents, interaction energies for related model systems demonstrate that this trend is independent of the substituted ring. Instead, the observed trends are consistent with direct electrostatic and dispersive interactions of the substituents with the unsubstituted ring.},

Herein we demonstrate the use of the macrocyclic host molecule cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) to facilitate reversible cross-linking of multivalent copolymers with high binding constants (Ka {\textgreater} 1011−1012 M−2) leading to a supramolecular hydrogel. Multivalent copolymers were prepared by free radical polymerization techniques and contained either pendant methyl viologen (a good first guest for CB[8]) or naphthoxy derivatives (good second guests for CB[8]). A colorless solution of the two multivalent copolymers bearing first and second guests, respectively, can be transformed into a highly viscous, colored supramolecular hydrogel with the cross-link density being easily controlled through CB[8] addition. Moreover, the cross-links (1:1:1 supramolecular ternary complexes of CB[8]/viologen/naphthoxy) are dynamic and stimuli-responsive, and the material properties can be modulated by temperature or other external stimuli. Rheological characterization of the bulk material properties of these dynamically cross-linked networks provided insight into the kinetics of CB[8] ternary complexation responsible for elastically active cross-linking with a second guest dissociation rate constant (kd) of 1200 s−1 for the ternary complex. These materials exhibited intermediate mechanical properties at 5 wt \% in water (plateau modulus = 350−600 Pa and zero-shear viscosity = 5−55 Pa·s), which is complementary to existing supramolecular hydrogels. Additionally, these supramolecular hydrogels exhibited thermal reversibility and subsequent facile modulation of microstructure upon further addition of CB[8] and thermal treatment. The fundamental knowledge gained from the study of these dynamic materials will facilitate progress in the field of smart, self-healing materials, self-assembled hydrogels, and controlled solution viscosity.},

This set is based on molecular changes common to many molecular design problems, such as insertion and deletion of atomic sites and changing atomic partial charges. We use this benchmark set to compare the statistical efficiency, reliability, and quality of uncertainty estimates for a number of published free energy methods, including thermodynamic integration, free energy perturbation, the Bennett acceptance ratio (BAR) and its multistate equivalent MBAR. We identify MBAR as the consistently best performing method, though other methods are frequently comparable in reliability and accuracy in many cases. We demonstrate that assumptions of Gaussian distributed errors in free energies are usually valid for most methods studied. We demonstrate that bootstrap error estimation is a robust and useful technique for estimating statistical variance for all free energy methods studied.

	abstract = {We demonstrate the efficient chemical vapor deposition synthesis of single-walled carbon nanotubes where the activity and lifetime of the catalysts are enhanced by water. Water-stimulated enhanced catalytic activity results in massive growth of superdense and vertically aligned nanotube forests with heights up to 2.5 millimeters that can be easily separated from the catalysts, providing nanotube material with carbon purity above 99.98\%. Moreover, patterned, highly organized intrinsic nanotube structures were successfully fabricated. The water-assisted synthesis method addresses many critical problems that currently plague carbon nanotube synthesis.
Addition of just a bit of water greatly accelerates the catalytic growth of long, pure single-walled carbon nanotubes and facilitates their separation.

	abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

To probe the biophysical characteristics that confer activity, we present here a molecular-dynamics and biophysical study of a cyclic antimicrobial peptide and its inactive linear analog. In the simulations, the cyclic peptide caused large perturbations in the bilayer and cooperatively opened a disordered toroidal pore, 1-2 nm in diameter. Electrophysiology measurements confirm discrete poration events of comparable size. We also show that lysine residues aligning parallel to each other in the cyclic but not linear peptide are crucial for function. By employing dual-color fluorescence burst analysis, we show that both peptides are able to fuse/aggregate liposomes but only the cyclic peptide is able to porate them. The results provide detailed insight on the molecular basis of activity of cyclic antimicrobial peptides.},

The coupling between the various mechanisms involved in the retention phenomenon is pointed out and discussed. The volume charge density of a NF polyamide membrane is determined from tangential streaming potential measurements. The SEDE model is then used to assess the rejection rate of the membrane, the dielectric constant of the solution filling pores being the single adjustable parameter of the model. It is clearly shown that the dielectric exclusion cannot be neglected in the analysis of the filtration properties of NF membranes. Indeed, the classical steric/electric exclusion theory is found to be unable to describe experimental rejection rates of the polyamide membrane under consideration.},

	abstract = {Limited searching in the conformational space is one of the major obstacles for investigating protein dynamics by numerical approaches. For this reason, classical all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins tend to be confined to local energy minima, particularly when the bulk solvent is treated explicitly. To overcome this problem, we have developed a novel replica exchange protocol that uses modified force-field parameters to treat interparticle nonbonded potentials within the protein and between protein and solvent atoms, leaving unperturbed those relative to solventsolvent interactions. We have tested the new protocol on the 18-residue-long tip of the P domain of calreticulin in an explicit solvent. With only eight replicas, we have been able to considerably enhance the conformational space sampled during a 100 ns simulation, compared to as many parallel classical molecular dynamics simulations of the same length or to a single one lasting 450 ns. A direct comparison between the various simulations has been possible thanks to the implementation of the weighted histogram analysis method, by which conformations simulated with modified force-field parameters can be assigned different weights. Interatom, inter-residue distances in the structural ensembles obtained with our novel replica exchange approach and by classical MD simulations compare equally well with those derived from NMR data. Rare events, such as unfolding and refolding, occur with reasonable statistical frequency. Visiting of conformations characterized by very small Boltzmann weights is also possible. Despite their low probability, such regions of the conformational space may play an important role in the search for local potential-energy minima and in dynamically controlled functions.},

A new relative reactivity volume (RRV) algorithm was developed to generate the cross-linking network by incorporating the correct regioselectivity (head-to-tail chain propagation) and monomer reactivity ratios. This is the first application of reactivity ratios for free radical addition polymerization in MD simulations. Prior cross-linking simulations were performed on step-growth epoxy resin curing. Vinyl esters studied here cure by free radical addition copolymerization. Cross-linked networks with double bond conversions up to 98\% were achieved. Volume shrinkage, glass transition temperatures, and tensile elastic constants were calculated. Predicted Young’s moduli were compared with experimental data. This RRV method can generate other thermoset and thermoplastic systems containing different monomers, and provide an approach for handling simultaneous irreversible reactions in MD simulations.},

	abstract = {This article describes the software suite GROMACS (Groningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) that was developed at the University of Groningen, The Netherlands, in the early 1990s. The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

	abstract = {Polymeric nanoparticles can be manufactured by intramolecular cross-linking of benzocyclobutene (BCB)/styrene copolymers. We study this process by extensive molecular dynamics simulations of both atomistic and coarse-grained models. It is found that the rate of intramolecular cross-linking is close to quadratic in the number of unlinked cross-linkers, namely BCB monomeric units, while the completeness of the reaction is affected by the steric hindrance of the cross-linked polymer. An equation incorporating both of these processes yields a good agreement with simulation data. A rigidity effect is identified when the cross-linkers account for more than about 60\% of a precursor BCB/styrene copolymer. Above this threshold, the radii of gyration of intramolecularly cross-linked BCB/styrene copolymers show little dependence on their cross-linker concentrations, and a relatively large number of BCB monomeric units are left unreacted in each polymer. In addition, a temperature series study is performed on the intramolecular cross-linking of freely jointed chain (FJC) samples. We introduce the chemical distance density to provide a relation between the topology of cross-linking and the structure of a cross-linked polymer. A power law relation is found between the radius of gyration of the polymer and the chemical distance density, in both FJC samples and BCB/styrene copolymers.},

	abstract = {In spite of all promising perspectives for nanofiltration, not only in drinking water production but also in wastewater treatment, the food industry, the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, and many other industries, there are still some unresolved problems that slow down large-scale applications. This paper identifies six challenges for nanofiltration where solutions are still scarce: (1) avoiding membrane fouling, and possibilities to remediate, (2) improving the separation between solutes that can be achieved, (3) further treatment of concentrates, (4) chemical resistance and limited lifetime of membranes, (5) insufficient rejection of pollutants in water treatment, and (6) the need for modelling and simulation tools.
The implementation of nanofiltration in the industry is a success story because these challenges can be dealt with for many applications, whereas more research would result in many more possible applications. It is suggested that these challenges should be among the main priorities on the research agenda for nanofiltration. This paper offers an overview of the state-of-the-art in these areas, without going into details about specific observations in individual studies, but rather aiming at giving the overall picture of possible drawbacks. This leads to suggestions which direction the nanofiltration research community should follow, and where research questions can be found. Evidently, the six identified challenges are to some extent interrelated; mutual influences are explained as well as possible solutions, or possible pathways to solutions.},

	abstract = {The computation of absolute binding affinities by molecular dynamics (MD) based free energy simulations is analyzed, and an exact method to carry out such a computation is presented. The key to obtaining converged results is the introduction of suitable, auxiliary restraints to prevent the ligand from leaving the binding site when the native ligandreceptor interactions are turned off alchemically. We describe a versatile set of restraints that (i) can be used in MD simulations, that (ii) restricts both the position and the orientation of the ligand, and that (iii) is defined relative to the receptor rather than relative to a fixed point in space. The free energy cost, DeltaAr, for this set of restraints can be evaluated analytically. Although the techniques were originally developed for the gas phase, the resulting expression is exact, since all contributions from solutesolvent interactions cancel from the final result. The value of DeltaAr depends only on the equilibrium values and force constants of the chosen harmonic restraint terms and, therefore, can be easily calculated. The standard state dependence of binding free energies is also investigated, and it is shown that the present approach takes this into account correctly. The analytical expression for DeltaAr is verified numerically by calculations on the complex formed by benzene with the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme. The overall approach is illustrated by a complete binding free energy calculation for a complex based on a simplified model for tyrosine bound to tyrosyl-tRNA-synthetase. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed set of restraints and confirm that the calculated binding free energy is independent of the details of the restraints. Comparisons are made with earlier formulations for the calculation of binding free energies, and certain limitations of that work are described. The relationship between DeltaAr and the loss of translational and rotational entropy during a binding process is analyzed.},

	abstract = {Metal–organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising porous materials for gas separation and storage as well as sensing. In particular, a series of isostructural MOFs with coordinately unsaturated metal centers, namely, CPO-27-M or M-MOF-74 (M = Mg, Zn, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu), have shown exceptional adsorption capacity and selectivity compared to those of classical MOFs that contain only fully coordinated metal sites. Although it is widely accepted that the interaction between guest molecules and exposed metal centers is responsible for good selectivity and large maximum uptake, the investigation of such guest–metal interaction is very challenging because adsorbed molecules are usually disordered in the pores and undergo rapid thermal motions. 2H solid-state NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy is one of the most extensively used techniques for capturing guest dynamics in porous materials. In this work, variable-temperature 2H wide-line SSNMR experiments were performed on CPO-27-M (M = Mg, Zn) loaded with four prototypical guest molecules: D2O, CD3CN, acetone-d6, and C6D6. The results indicate that different guest molecules possess distinct dynamic behaviors inside the channel of CPO-27-M. For a given guest molecule, its dynamic behavior also depends on the nature of the metal centers. The binding strength of guest molecules is discussed on the basis of the 2H SSNMR data.},

	abstract = {Separation of gases and liquids mixtures into their constituents is crucial for many industrial processes. Accordingly, development of high performance membranes with enhanced permeability, salt rejections and low energy consumption has drawn many researchers’ attentions. High potential candidates are Mixed-Matrix Membranes (MMMs) combining the benefits of both polymer and carbon nano-tubes (CNTs) for high processability, selectivity and throughput. However, there are still challenging issues, such as, poor miscibility between the polymeric phase and the carbon nano-tubes and the ensuing phase separation problems. In this study, by combining experiments and multiscale modeling approaches (i.e., molecular dynamics and mesoscale simulation), we focus on (1) the functionalization of multi walled CNTs (MWCNTs) to improve the compatibility between MWCNTs and a co-polyimide (P84) and to obtain homogeneous dispersion without phase separation problems and on (2) the mechanism and validation of homogeneous dispersion of MWCNTs through P84. First, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to calculate the solubility parameters of various CNTs, pristine and functionalized with the polar groups –OH and –NH2, and polymer matrix used for CNT/polymer composite membrane fabrication. After then, mesoscale simulations are executed to understand the macroscopic CNT dispersion through the polymer matrix. Finally, modeling results are validated by experimental data obtained by the preparation of composite P84 membranes containing MWCNTs pristine or functionalized. The MWCNTs functionalization is carried out by oxidation or amination procedure in order to introduce oxygenated and amine species, respectively. A good agreement between theoretical calculation and experimental results is achieved confirming the necessity to functionalize the MWCNTs with polar groups in order to obtain a good dispersion in the hydrophilic P84 matrix and the prediction of an optimum range of functional groups in order to obtain well dispersed MMM.},

	abstract = {Drug discovery is a highly complex and costly process, which demands integrated efforts in several relevant aspects involving innovation, knowledge, information, technologies, expertise, R\&D investments and management skills. The shift from traditional to genomics- and proteomics-based drug research has fundamentally transformed key R\&D strategies in the pharmaceutical industry addressed to the design of new chemical entities as drug candidates against a variety of biological targets. Therefore, drug discovery has moved toward more rational strategies based on our increasing understanding of the fundamental principles of protein-ligand interactions. The combination of available knowledge of several 3D protein structures with hundreds of thousands of small-molecules have attracted the attention of scientists from all over the world for the application of structure- and ligand-based drug design approaches. In this context, virtual screening technologies have largely enhanced the impact of computational methods applied to chemistry and biology and the goal of applying such methods is to reduce large compound databases and to select a limited number of promising candidates for drug design. This review provides a perspective of the utility of virtual screening in drug design and its integration with other important drug discovery technologies such as high-throughput screening (HTS) and QSAR, highlighting the present challenges, limitations, and future perspectives in medicinal chemistry.

This has enabled the investigation of numerous compounds with this architecture, and ligands with a wide variety of interesting biological targets have thus been discovered. Furthermore, detailed biophysical and structural studies focusing on the investigation of the conformational space adopted and three-dimensional folding of these peptide mimics have been undertaken. The same is true for beta-peptides (i.e., oligomers composed of beta-amino acids). Since the first publication describing peptide mimics combining these two structural modifications [the N-alkyl-beta-alanines (beta-peptoids)] in 1998, on the other hand, the application of this backbone construct has appeared much more sparsely in the literature.

This conclusion is further strengthened when a vibrational zero-point correction to the electronic binding energies of this dimer is made, which increases the difference between the two configurations to 0.4−0.5 kcal/mol. The binding energies of 2.4 and 2.8 kcal/mol for the T and PD configurations are in good accord with the previous experimental result from ionization potential measurement.},

	abstract = {In molecular mechanics (MM) studies, atom types and/or bond types of molecules are needed to determine prior to energy calculations. We present here an automatic algorithm of perceiving atom types that are defined in a description table, and an automatic algorithm of assigning bond types just based on atomic connectivity. The algorithms have been implemented in a new module of the AMBER packages. This auxiliary module, antechamber (roughly meaning “before AMBER”), can be applied to generate necessary inputs of leap—the AMBER program to generate topologies for minimization, molecular dynamics, etc., for most organic molecules. The algorithms behind the manipulations may be useful for other molecular mechanical packages as well as applications that need to designate atom types and bond types.},

As many such enzymes are found in multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, novel β-lactamase inhibitors are urgently needed. Five unique 6-alkylidene-2′-substituted penicillanic acid sulfones (1−5) were synthesized and tested against OXA-24, a clinically important β-lactamase that inactivates carbapenems and is found in A. baumannii. Based upon the roles Tyr112 and Met223 play in the OXA-24 β-lactamase, we also engineered two variants (Tyr112Ala and Tyr112Ala,Met223Ala) to test the hypothesis that the hydrophobic tunnel formed by these residues influences inhibitor recognition. IC50 values against OXA-24 and two OXA-24 β-lactamase variants ranged from 10 ± 1 (4 vs WT) to 338 ± 20 nM (5 vs Tyr112Ala, Met223Ala). Compound 4 possessed the lowest Ki (500 ± 80 nM vs WT), and 1 possessed the highest inactivation efficiency (kinact/Ki = 0.21 ± 0.02 μM−1 s−1). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed a single covalent adduct, suggesting the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. X-ray structures of OXA-24 complexed to four inhibitors (2.0−2.6 {\textbackslash}AA) reveal the formation of stable bicyclic aromatic intermediates with their carbonyl oxygen in the oxyanion hole. These data provide the first structural evidence that 6-alkylidene-2′-substituted penicillin sulfones are effective mechanism-based inactivators of class D β-lactamases. Their unique chemistry makes them developmental candidates. Mechanisms for class D hydrolysis and inhibition are discussed, and a pathway for the evolution of the BlaR1 sensor of Staphylococcus aureus to the class D β-lactamases is proposed.},

	abstract = {Almost fifteen years ago, the first non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NNRTI) lead compounds have been discovered. Nowadays, three NNRTIs are approved for treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals and several others are subject of (advanced) clinical trials. Although the NNRTIs target HIV-1 RT, they are clearly different from the nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs). They are highly selective for HIV-1 and do not inhibit HIV-2 or any other (retro)virus. They target HIV-1 RT by a direct interaction without the need to be metabolised by cellular enzymes, and they interact at a site on the HIV-1 RT that is near to, but distant from, the substrate-binding site. The majority of NNRTIs share common conformational properties and structural features that let them fit in a hydrophobic pocket at the HIV-1 RT, which is nowadays well-characterized. A wide variety of crystal structures of RT complexed with NNRTIs have been obtained. They provide detailed insights in the molecular interaction of the NNRTIs with the amino acids lining the pocket in HIV-1 RT. Due to their unprecedented specificity, the NNRTIs are relatively non-toxic in cell culture, and the most potent compounds reach selectivity indices that exceed 100,000 or more. However, inherent to their high specificity, the NNRTIs easily select for mutant virus strains with several degrees of drug resistance. The first-generation NNRTIs such as nevirapine and delavirdine easily loose their inhibitory potential against mutant virus strains that contain single amino acid mutations in their RT. The second-generation NNRTIs such as efavirenz, capravirine and dapivirine usually require two or more mutations in the HIV-1 RT before significantly decreasing their antiviral potency. Evidently, it requires a markedly longer time period to obtain significant resistance against second-generation NNRTIs. The resistance spectrum of NNRTIs is entirely different from the NRTI resistance spectrum, and, as a rule, NRTI-resistant mutant virus strains keep full sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of NNRTIs, and vice versa NNRTI-resistant and mutant virus strains keep full sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of NRTIs. NNRTIs have proven beneficial when included in drug combination (triple or quadruple) therapy, preferably in the presence of protease inhibitors and NRTIs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {A macromolecular nanopore inserted into a membrane may perturb the dynamic organization of the surrounding lipid bilayer. To better understand the nature of such perturbations, we have undertaken a systematic molecular dynamics simulation study of lipid bilayer structure and dynamics around three different classes of nanopore: a carbon nanotube, three related cyclic peptide nanotubes differing in the nature of their external surfaces, and a model of a ?-barrel nanopore protein. Periodic spatial distributions of several lipid properties as a function of distance from the nanopore were observed. This was especially clear for the carbon nanotube system, for which the density of lipids, the bilayer thickness, the projection of lipid head-to-tail vectors onto the membrane plane, and lipid lateral diffusion coefficients exhibited undulatory behavior as a function of the distance from the surface of the channel. Overall, the differences in lipid behavior as a function of the nanopore structure reveal local adaptation of the bilayer structure and dynamics to different embedded nanopore structures. Both the local structure and dynamic behavior of lipids around membrane-embedded nanopores are sensitive to the geometry and nature of the outer surface of the macromolecule/molecular assembly forming the pore.},

However, conventional NFMs suffer from broad pore size distribution, which limits their applications for fine separation, especially in complete separation of molecules with slight differences in molecular size. Herein, defect-free composite NFMs with narrow pore size distribution are fabricated using a contra-diffusion method, with dopamine/polyethylenimine solution on the skin side and ammonium persulfate solution on the other side of the ultrafiltration substrate. Persulfate ions can diffuse through the ultrafiltration substrate into the other side and in situ trigger dopamine to form a codeposited coating with polyethylenimine. The codeposition is hindered on those sites completely covered by the polydopamine/polyethylenimine coating, although it is promoted at the defects or highly permeable regions because it is induced by the diffused persulfate ions. Such a “self-completion” process results in NFMs with highly uniform structures and narrow pore size distribution, as determined by their rejection of neutral solutes. These near electrically neutral NFMs show a high rejection of divalent ions with a low rejection of monovalent ions (MgCl2 rejection = 96\%, NaCl rejection = 23\%), majorly based on a steric hindrance effect. The as-prepared NFMs can be applied in molecular separation such as isolating cellulose hydrogenation products.},

Despite a shaky early history, computer-aided drug design techniques can now be effective in reducing costs and speeding up drug discovery. This happy outcome results from development of more accurate and reliable algorithms, use of more thoughtfully planned strategies to apply them, and greatly increased computer power to allow studies with the necessary reliability to be performed. Our review focuses on applications and protocols, with the main emphasis on critical analysis of recent studies where docking calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were combined to dock small molecules into protein receptors. We highlight successes to demonstrate what is possible now, but also point out drawbacks and future directions. The review is structured to lead the reader from the simpler to more compute-intensive methods. Thus, while inexpensive and fast docking algorithms can be used to scan large compound libraries and reduce their size, more accurate but expensive MD simulations can be applied when a few selected ligand candidates remain. MD simulations can be used: during the preparation of the protein receptor before docking, to optimize its structure and account for protein flexibility; for the refinement of docked complexes, to include solvent effects and account for induced fit; to calculate binding free energies, to provide an accurate ranking of the potential ligands; and in the latest developments, during the docking process itself to find the binding site and correctly dock the ligand a priori. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Confinement of matter on the nanometre scale can induce phase transitions not seen in bulk systems. In the case of water, so-called drying transitions occur on this scale as a result of strong hydrogen-bonding between water molecules, which can cause the liquid to recede from nonpolar surfaces to form a vapour layer separating the bulk phase from the surface. Here we report molecular dynamics simulations showing spontaneous and continuous filling of a nonpolar carbon nanotube with a one-dimensionally ordered chain of water molecules. Although the molecules forming the chain are in chemical and thermal equilibrium with the surrounding bath, we observe pulse-like transmission of water through the nanotube. These transmission bursts result from the tight hydrogen-bonding network inside the tube, which ensures that density fluctuations in the surrounding bath lead to concerted and rapid motion along the tube axis. We also find that a minute reduction in the attraction between the tube wall and water dramatically affects pore hydration, leading to sharp, two-state transitions between empty and filled states on a nanosecond timescale. These observations suggest that carbon nanotubes, with their rigid nonpolar structures, might be exploited as unique molecular channels for water and protons, with the channel occupancy and conductivity tunable by changes in the local channel polarity and solvent conditions.},

In addition, the molecules that constitute the membrane are, allowed to vibrate. The effect of the important driving forces in these separations, viz., pressure, concentration, temperature and electric field strength, has been investigated. These results show that the water and methanol molecules cluster strongly around the ions in these simulations, and this plays a significant role in membrane based separations in both aqueous and methanolic solutions-an effect of which the importance was not previously recognized. In addition, studies have been made of the self-diffusion coefficients and density profiles in these systems. It has been found that external electric fields usually lead to a large measurable increase in the rate of reverse osmosis separations.},

An ideal nanoporous membrane would consist of a thin film with physically continuous and vertically aligned nanopores and would display a narrow distribution of pore sizes. However, the current state of the art departs considerably from this ideal and is beset by intrinsic trade-offs between permeability and selectivity. We demonstrate an effective and scalable method to fabricate polymer films with ideal membrane morphologies consisting of submicron thickness films with physically continuous and vertically aligned 1 nm pores. The approach is based on soft confinement to control the orientation of a cross-linkable mesophase in which the pores are produced by self-assembly. The scalability, exceptional ease of fabrication, and potential to create a new class of nanofiltration membranes stand out as compelling aspects.},

This has enabled the investigation of numerous compounds with this architecture, and ligands with a wide variety of interesting biological targets have thus been discovered. Furthermore, detailed biophysical and structural studies focusing on the investigation of the conformational space adopted and three-dimensional folding of these peptide mimics have been undertaken. The same is true for beta-peptides (i.e., oligomers composed of beta-amino acids). Since the first publication describing peptide mimics combining these two structural modifications [the N-alkyl-beta-alanines (beta-peptoids)] in 1998, on the other hand, the application of this backbone construct has appeared much more sparsely in the literature.

	abstract = {This chapter discusses small-angle scattering experiments with particles in solution—i.e., the particles are nonoriented. A large number of particles contribute to the scattering and the resulting spatial average leads to a loss in information. The information contained in the three-dimensional electron density distribution is thereby reduced to the one-dimensional distance distribution function. This function is proportional to the number of lines with length, which connect any volume element i with any volume element k of the same particle. The spatial orientation of these connection lines is of no account to the function. The connection lines are weighted by the product of the number of electrons situated in the volume elements i and k, respectively. The correlation between the function and the structure of the particle is also discussed in the chapter. The connection between the distance distribution function and the measured experimental scattering curve is also shown. It is observed that the each distance between two electrons of the particle, which is part of the function, leads to an angular-dependent scattering intensity. This physical process of scattering can be mathematically expressed by a Fourier transformation, which defines the way in which the information in “real space” (distance distribution function) is transformed into “reciprocal space” (scattering function). The chapter also discusses monochromatization and the camera type developed in Graz.},

	abstract = {Rotigotine is a highly lipophilic dopamine-receptor agonist and the first transdermally delivered agent to demonstrate efficacy and safety as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease and to reduce "off" hours in levodopa-treated patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. The rotigotine pharmacophore is nonergolinic and demonstrates high affinity for dopamine D(2) and D(3) receptors. With once-daily application, the patch matrix provides continuous, nonfluctuating plasma drug levels at steady state, resulting in continuous and steady plasma and brain levels and striatal dopamine-receptor stimulation. In early Parkinson's disease, doses of rotigotine up to 8 mg/24 hours demonstrate comparable efficacy to ropinirole (at doses up to 12 mg/day); in advanced Parkinson's disease, doses of rotigotine up to 16 mg/24 hours demonstrate comparable efficacy and tolerability to pramipexole (at doses up to 4.5 mg/day). In the registration trials for early and advanced Parkinson's disease, the adverse effects most commonly observed with rotigotine were minor application site reactions, dizziness, nausea, and somnolence. Doses of transdermal rotigotine can be titrated to a maintenance dose within 2-3 weeks, and the once-daily regimen minimizes complexity of therapy. The transdermal delivery system is also an advantage when nonoral administration is desired, and the 24-hour, continuous, nonfluctuating drug levels can improve early morning and nocturnal symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Thus, transdermally delivered rotigotine is a clinically innovative and useful addition to the dopamine-receptor agonist class. This review summarizes the key pharmacologic and clinical data for rotigotine and provides a focused clinical context for its use in early-to-advanced Parkinson's disease, as well as a brief summary for its role in restless legs syndrome.},

	abstract = {Advances in modern computational methods and technology make it possible to carry out extensive molecular dynamics simulations of complex membrane proteins based on detailed atomic models. The ultimate goal of such detailed simulations is to produce trajectories in which the behavior of the system is as realistic as possible. A critical aspect that requires consideration in the case of biological membrane systems is the existence of a net electric potential difference across the membrane. For meaningful computations, it is important to have well validated methodologies for incorporating the latter in molecular dynamics simulations. A widely used treatment of the membrane potential in molecular dynamics consists of applying an external uniform electric field E perpendicular to the membrane. The field acts on all charged particles throughout the simulated system, and the resulting applied membrane potential V is equal to the applied electric field times the length of the periodic cell in the direction perpendicular to the membrane. A series of test simulations based on simple membrane-slab models are carried out to clarify the consequences of the applied field. These illustrative tests demonstrate that the constant-field method is a simple and valid approach for accounting for the membrane potential in molecular dynamics studies of biomolecular systems.

However, the structural interpretation of WAXS profiles is problematic, partly because accurate calculations of WAXS profiles from structural models have remained challenging. In this work, we present the calculation of WAXS profiles from explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of five different proteins. Using only a single fitting parameter that accounts for experimental uncertainties because of the buffer subtraction and dark currents, we find excellent agreement to experimental profiles both at small and wide angles. Because explicit solvation eliminates free parameters associated with the solvation layer or the excluded solvent, which would require fitting to experimental data, we minimize the risk of overfitting. We further find that the influence from water models and protein force fields on calculated profiles are insignificant up to q≈15nm−1. Using a series of simulations that allow increasing flexibility of the proteins, we show that incorporating thermal fluctuations into the calculations significantly improves agreement with experimental data, demonstrating the importance of protein dynamics in the interpretation of WAXS profiles. In addition, free MD simulations up to one microsecond suggest that the calculated profiles are highly sensitive with respect to minor conformational rearrangements of proteins, such as an increased flexibility of a loop or an increase of the radius of gyration by {\textless} 1\%. The present study suggests that quantitative comparison between MD simulations and experimental WAXS profiles emerges as an accurate tool to validate solution ensembles of biomolecules.},

We observe that the substrate temperature has a dramatic impact on the crystal growth, producing two distinct polymorphs of TMS-DBC; low temperature (LT) fine red needles and high temperature (HT) large yellow platelets. Single crystal X-ray crystallography confirms packing structures where the LT crystals form a 1D slipped-stack structure, while the HT crystals adopt a 2D brickwork motif. These polymorphs also represent a rare example where both are extremely stable and do not interconvert to the other crystal structure upon solvent or thermal annealing. Single crystal organic field-effect transistors of the LT and HT crystals show that the HT 2D brickwork motif produces hole mobilities as high as 2.1 cm2 V–1 s–1, while the mobility of the 1D structure is significantly lower, at 0.028 cm2 V–1 s–1. Electronic-structure calculations indicate that the superior charge transport in the brickwork polymorph in comparison to the slipped-stack polymorph is due to the presence of an increased dimensionality of the charge migration pathways.},

Thermodynamic and mechanical properties were calculated as a function of the cross-link density. A new relative reactivity volume (RRV) algorithm was developed to generate the cross-linking network by incorporating the correct regioselectivity (head-to-tail chain propagation) and monomer reactivity ratios. This is the first application of reactivity ratios for free radical addition polymerization in MD simulations. Prior cross-linking simulations were performed on step-growth epoxy resin curing. Vinyl esters studied here cure by free radical addition copolymerization. Cross-linked networks with double bond conversions up to 98\% were achieved. Volume shrinkage, glass transition temperatures, and tensile elastic constants were calculated. Predicted Young’s moduli were compared with experimental data. This RRV method can generate other thermoset and thermoplastic systems containing different monomers, and provide an approach for handling simultaneous irreversible reactions in MD simulations.},

	abstract = {Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer. The input files are simple and currently compatible with PDB, Tinker, Molden, or Moldy coordinate files.

	abstract = {Throughout the world, water scarcity is being recognised as a present or future threat to human activity and as a consequence, a definite trend to develop alternative water resources such as desalination can be observed. The most commonly used desalination technologies are reverse osmosis (RO) and thermal processes such as multi-stage flash (MSF) and multi-effect distillation (MED). In Europe, reverse osmosis, due to its lower energy consumption has gained much wider acceptance than its thermal alternatives. This review summarises the current state-of-the art of reverse osmosis desalination, dealing not only with the reverse osmosis stage, but with the entire process from raw water intake to post treatment of product water. The discussion of process fundamentals, membranes and membrane modules and of current and future developments in membrane technology is accompanied by an analysis of operational issues as fouling and scaling and of measures for their prevention such as adequate cleaning procedures and antiscalant use. Special focus is placed on pre-treatment of raw water and post-treatment of brine as well as of product water to meet drinking and irrigation water standards, including evaluation of current boron removal options. Energy requirements of reverse osmosis plants as well as currently applied energy recovery systems for reduction of energy consumption are described and cost and cost structure of reverse osmosis desalination are outlined. Finally, current practices of waste management and disposal as well as new trends such as the use of hybrid plants, i.e. combining reverse osmosis with thermal processes and/or power generation are addressed.},

The hybrid functional includes an ad hoc mixture of half the exact (HF) exchange with half of the uniform electron gas exchange, plus Lee, Yang, and Parr's expression for correlation energy. This functional, in combination with polarized, diffuse basis sets, gives a binding energy for the parallel-displaced benzene dimer in good agreement with the best available high-level calculations reported in the literature, and qualitatively reproduces the local MP2 potential energy surface of the parallel-displaced benzene dimer. This method was further critically compared to high-level calculations recently reported in the literature for a range of π-stacked complexes, including monosubstituted benzene–benzene dimers, along with DNA and RNA bases, and generally agrees with MP2 and/or CCSD(T) results to within ±2 kJ mol−1. We also show that the resulting BH\&H binding energy is closely related to the electron density in the intermolecular region. The net result is that the BH\&H functional, presumably due to fortuitous cancellation of errors, provides a pragmatic, computationally efficient quantum mechanical tool for the study of large π-stacked systems such as DNA. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Nanofiltration membranes (NF) have applications in several areas. One of the main applications has been in watertreatment for drinking water production as well as wastewater treatment. NF can either be used to treat all kinds of water including ground, surface, and wastewater or used as a pretreatment for desalination. The introduction of NF as a pretreatment is considered a breakthrough for the desalination process. NF membranes have been shown to be able to remove turbidity, microorganisms and hardness, as well as a fraction of the dissolved salts. This results in a significantly lower operating pressure and thus provides a much more energy-efficient process. Similar to other membrane processes, a major problem in NF membrane applications is fouling. Several studies have investigated the mechanisms of fouling in NF membranes and suggested methods to minimize and control the fouling of NF membranes. For NF membrane characterizations and process prediction, modeling of NF processes and the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) are very important. The ability to predict the performance of NF processes will lead to a lower number of experiments, saving of time and money, and help to understand the separation mechanisms during NF. A comprehensive review of NF in water treatments is presented including a review of the applications of NF in treating water as well as in the pretreatment process for desalination; the mechanism as well as minimization of NF membrane fouling problems; and theories for modelling and transport of salt, charged and noncharged organic compounds in NF membranes. The review will also address the application of AFM in studying the morphology of membrane surfaces as part of the NF membrane characterization.},

The structures reveal inhibitor binding is exclusively hydrophobic in nature and the shape of the inhibitor-bound NNRTI binding pocket is unique among other reported inhibitor−RT crystal structures. Primarily, ADAMs 3 and 4 protrude from a large gap in the back side of the binding pocket, placing portions of the inhibitors unusually close to the polymerase active site and allowing 3 to form a weak hydrogen bond with Lys223. The lack of additional stabilizing interactions, beyond the observed hydrophobic surface contacts, between 4 and RT is quite perplexing given the extreme potency of the compound (IC50 ≤ 1 nM). ADAM 4 was designed to be hydrolytically stable in blood plasma, and an investigation of its hydrolysis in rat plasma demonstrated it has a significantly prolonged half-life in comparison to ADAM lead compounds 1 and 2.},

We have therefore performed a systematic crystal structure prediction search for minima in the lattice energy of crystalline paracetamol. The stable monoclinic form is found as the global lattice-energy minimum, but there are at least a dozen energetically feasible structures found, including the well-characterized metastable orthorhombic phase. Hence, we require additional criteria to reduce the number of hypothetical crystal structures that can be considered as potential polymorphs. For this purpose the elastic properties and vapor growth morphology of the known and predicted structures have been estimated using second-derivative analysis and the attachment-energy model. These inexpensive calculations give reasonable agreement with the available experimental data for the known polymorphs. Some of the hypothetical structures are predicted to have a low growth rate and platelike morphology, and so are unlikely to be observed. Another is only marginally mechanically stable. Thus, this first consideration of such properties in a crystal-structure prediction study appears to reduce the number of predicted polymorphs while leaving a few candidates for the uncharacterized form.},

Thus, timely identification of drug resistant HIV strains and precise evaluation of the level of resistance to the different antiretroviral drugs are crucial in the management of treated patients. Phenotypic determination of antiretroviral drug resistance evaluates the ability of an HIV strain to replicate in the presence of drug(s). Thus, this assay (either conventional or recombinant) provides a direct estimate of drug susceptibility. However, it is relatively difficult to perform and requires dedicated facilities. Thus, its use is still restricted. Genotypic determination of drug resistance is based upon detection of specific mutations in HIV genes encoding target enzymes or receptors. The assay provides an indirect evidence of drug susceptibility. However, it is easy to perform and does not require dedicated facilities. Thus, it is widely utilized in clinical practice. Its major limitation concerns the complexity of results interpretation which still awaits a general consensus. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

These compounds can be grouped into two classes: the first generation NNRTIs, mainly discovered by random screening, and the second generation NNRTIs, developed as a result of comprehensive strategies involving molecular modelling, rationale-based drug synthesis, biological and pharmacokinetic evaluations. The recent boom of NNRTIs is mainly due to their antiviral potency, high specificity and low toxicity. The rapid emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains induced by the first generation drugs is a disadvantage bypassed, in part, by the broad spectrum second generation NNRTIs. Starting from the first generation, this review will focus on the second generation NNRTIs dealing with the recent and most interesting published results, highlighting the guidelines for the development of a third generation of NNRTIs.

Over the past decade, there have been intensive and continuous efforts in the development of TFC membrane, both from the industry and academia with the interests to further improve the membrane productivity and selectivity as well as its tolerance against chlorine, solvent, fouling, etc. On basis of a brief introduction of the development history of TFC membranes, this paper reviews the recent research progress of the TFC membrane science and technology, particularly in the fields of water-related separation processes. Reviewing the research progress is imperative and necessary in order to provide an insight for the future development and perhaps open a door to extend the applications to other more challenging areas.},

	abstract = {In this work, the solvent-mediated phase transformation of the metastable form (Form II) to the stable form (Form I) of ethenzamide–saccharin cocrystal in isopropanol was investigated. Solubility of Form I and Form II in pure isopropanol was also measured. The transformation mechanism from Form II to Form I was analyzed by some online and off-line tools including attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and polarizing microscopy. The results demonstrate that the transformation process consists of three steps, involving the dissolution of Form II, the nucleation of Form I, and the following growth of Form I. The ATR-FTIR and Raman results show that the polymorphic transformation from Form II to Form I is controlled by the nucleation and growth of Form I. Furthermore, the microscope photographs clearly reveal that the Form I preferably nucleates and grows on the (100) surface of Form II. The molecular simulation results indicate that higher adsorption energy and the exposure of more activity groups make the molecule adsorbed more strongly on the (100) surface, which is in agreement with the experimental observation. The results drawn in this work will be of great significance to control the formation of a desired polymorphic final product of ethenzamide–saccharin cocrystal.},

A united atom model is employed for the surfactants with fully atomistic counterions and water. This gemini architecture, in which two single tailed surfactants are joined through a flexible hydrophobic linker, has been shown to exhibit concentration-dependent aqueous self-assembly into lyotropic phases including hexagonal, gyroid, and lamellar morphologies. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed phases at similar amphiphile concentrations in water, including the unusual ability of these surfactants to form gyroid phases over unprecedentedly large amphiphile concentration windows. We demonstrate quantitative agreement between the predicted and experimentally observed domain spacings of these nanostructured materials. Through careful conformation analyses of the surfactant molecules, we show that the gyroid phase is electrostatically stabilized related to the lamellar phase. By starting with a lamellar phase, we show that use of a bulkier N(CH3)4+ counterion in place of Na+ drives the formation of a gyroid phase. Decreasing the charge on the surfactant headgroups by carboxylate protonation decreases the degree of order in the lamellar phase. Using our models, we show that the translational diffusion of water and the Na+ counterions is decreased by several orders of magnitude over the studied concentration range, and we attribute these effects to strong correlations between the mobile species and the surfactant headgroups.},

	abstract = {It has recently been shown that the highly protected segments 24-34 (S2) and 83-93 (S8) of each of the two 99-mers of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease play an essential role in the folding of the monomers, giving rise to the so-called (postcritical) folding nucleus ((FN) minimum condensation unit ensuring folding) when they dock. This scenario received further support from model calculations that demonstrated that the peptide p-S8, displaying an amino acid sequence identical to the corresponding (83-93) segment of the monomer, can be used to interfere with the formation of the FN and eventually to inhibit folding by docking the fragment 24-34. Experiments in vitro and in cells infected with ex vivo wild-type and multiresistant HIV isolates confirm that the inhibition power of p-S8 is robust. On the other hand, there is no direct evidence demonstrating the validity of the proposed mechanism of inhibition associated with p-S8. To shed light on this question and to provide the basis for the design of a molecule mimetic to p-S8, to be used as lead of an eventual drug against AIDS, we study, in this paper, with the help of all-atom simulations in explicit solvent and the novel method of metadynamics combined with parallel tempering: a), the free energy and the equilibrium structure of each of the peptides p-S2 and p-S8; b), the details of the docking mechanism of the two peptides and the free energy associated with this process. Whereas p-S8 is found to be well structured, p-S2 is rather flexible, wrapping itself around p-S8 to give rise to the FN, which is stabilized by three particular hydrogen bonds.},

The calculated diffusion coefficients and electric conductivities compare very well with the measurements across a wide composition range. We then extract static (radial distribution functions, coordination numbers distributions) and dynamic (cage correlation functions) quantities from the simulations. Then, we discuss the interplay between the microscopic structure of the molten salts and their dynamic properties. It is often considered that variations in the diffusion coefficient of the anions are mainly driven by the evolution of its coordination with the metallic ion (Y3+ here). We compare this system with fluorozirconate melts and demonstrate that the coordination number is a poor indicator of the evolution of the diffusion coefficient. Instead, we propose to use the ionic bonds lifetime. We show that the weak Y–F ionic bonds in LiF–YF3 do not induce the expected tendency of the fluoride diffusion coefficient to converge toward one of the yttrium cation when the content in YF3 increases. Implications on the validity of the Nernst-Einstein relation for estimating the electrical conductivity are discussed.},

A microcanonical analysis, where the energy is the natural variable, has proved to be better suited than its canonical counterpart to unambiguously characterize the nature of the transition. Replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations of a high-resolution coarse-grained model allow for the accurate evaluation of the density of states in order to extract precise thermodynamic information and measure its impact on structural features. The method has been applied to three helical peptides: a short helix shows sharp features of a two-state folder, while a longer helix and a three-helix bundle exhibit downhill and two-state transitions, respectively. Extending the results of lattice simulations and theoretical models, we have found that it is the interplay between secondary structure and the loss of non-native tertiary contacts that determines the nature of the transition.},

	abstract = {Two-probe electrochemical cells were designed for proton conductivity evaluation in the X, Y and Z directions using electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Nafion® 112, 115, 1135, 117 and 211 membranes were used to examine the conductivity in the three given directions, and to determine the influence of cell configuration and probe geometry on the accuracy and reproducibility of the measurement. Emphasis is placed on obtaining an understanding of the real system and adequate transfer of the physical processes into the form of the equivalent circuit for the extraction of reliable conductivity data. In order to verify that the method can determine anisotropic conductivity, novel fluorous block copolymers with various anisotropic phase segregated morphologies were evaluated. All polymer electrolyte membranes examined exhibited a Nyquist plot response in the form of a straight line with an angle of approximately 70°–80° to the Z′-axis. Interfacial capacitance, membrane bulk resistance and membrane bulk capacitance were considered as contributing parameters to the impedance of the system; high frequency inductance and contact resistance were instrumentally minimized. A marginally anisotropic conductivity (σ=/σ⊥ = 1.0–1.4) was found in all Nafion® samples. Fluorous block copolymers with disordered morphology exhibited higher conductivity in the through-plane direction by a factor of 1.4. For the polymers with perforated lamellae and lamellae morphologies, in-plane conductivities were larger by factors of 2.4 and 5.5, respectively.},

	abstract = {The effects of log-normal pore size distributions on the rejection of uncharged solutes and NaCl at hypothetical nanofiltration membranes have been assessed theoretically. The importance of pore radius-dependent properties such as solvent viscosity and dielectric constant is increased by the introduction of a pore size distribution in calculations. However, the effect of porewise variation in viscosity is less apparent when considered at a defined applied pressure rather than at a defined flux, showing a further advantage of basing theoretical analysis of nanofiltration in terms of applied pressure.
Truncated pore size distributions gave better agreement than full distributions with experimental rejection data for a Desal-DK nanofiltration membrane. Such truncation is in agreement with the findings of atomic force microscopy (AFM). Analysis of uncharged solute rejection data alone could not give useful information about membrane pore size distribution. Neither could such a distribution be obtained quantitatively directly from AFM images. However, use of the shape of the distribution obtained by AFM in conjunction with experimental rejection data for an uncharged solute allows calculation of corrected distributions. Importantly, incorporation of such a corrected pore size distribution in calculations of NaCl rejection gave better agreement with experimental data, compared to calculations assuming uniform pores, at high pressure, the region of industrial interest.},

Polarized light microscopy (PLM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques have been employed for the characterization of LLC systems. Time-resolved fluorescence results reveal the retarded ESPT dynamics inside liquid crystalline systems compared to bulk water, and it follows the order HII {\textless} Ia3d {\textless} Pn3m {\textless} H2O. The slower solvation, hampered ?Grotthuss? proton transfer process, and most importantly, topological influence, of the LLC systems are believed to be mainly responsible for the slower and different extent of ESPT dynamics. Interestingly, recombination dynamics is found to be faster with respect to bulk water and it follows the order H2O {\textless} Pn3m {\textless} Ia3d {\textless} HII. Faster recombination dynamics arises due to lower dielectric constant and different channel diameters of these LLC systems. However, the dissociation dynamics is found to be slower than bulk water and it follows the order HII {\textless} Ia3d {\textless} Pn3m {\textless} H2O. Differences in critical packing parameter of LLC systems are believed to be the governing factors for the slower dissociation dynamics in these liquid crystalline systems.},

	abstract = {α-Hemolysin of Staphylococcus aureus is a self-assembling toxin that forms a water-filled transmembrane channel upon oligomerization in a lipid membrane. Apart from being one of the best-studied toxins of bacterial origin, α-hemolysin is the principal component in several biotechnological applications, including systems for controlled delivery of small solutes across lipid membranes, stochastic sensors for small solutes, and an alternative to conventional technology for DNA sequencing. Through large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we studied the permeability of the α-hemolysin/lipid bilayer complex for water and ions. The studied system, composed of ∼300,000 atoms, included one copy of the protein, a patch of a DPPC lipid bilayer, and a 1 M water solution of KCl. Monitoring the fluctuations of the pore structure revealed an asymmetric, on average, cross section of the α-hemolysin stem. Applying external electrostatic fields produced a transmembrane ionic current; repeating simulations at several voltage biases yielded a current/voltage curve of α-hemolysin and a set of electrostatic potential maps. The selectivity of α-hemolysin to Cl− was found to depend on the direction and the magnitude of the applied voltage bias. The results of our simulations are in excellent quantitative agreement with available experimental data. Analyzing trajectories of all water molecule, we computed the α-hemolysin’s osmotic permeability for water as well as its electroosmotic effect, and characterized the permeability of its seven side channels. The side channels were found to connect seven His-144 residues surrounding the stem of the protein to the bulk solution; the protonation of these residues was observed to affect the ion conductance, suggesting the seven His-144 to comprise the pH sensor that gates conductance of the α-hemolysin channel.},

Side-chain liquid crystalline polyethers (SCLCPs), based on poly(epichlorohydrin) (PECH) and poly(epichlorohydrin-co-ethylene oxide) (P(ECH-co-EO)), dendronized with potassium 3,4,5-tris[4-(n-dodecan-1-yloxy)benzyloxy]benzoate were specially designed for this purpose. When cast as membranes, these tailored polymers self-assembled into columns, driven by exo-recognition. They thus mimic the highly specific supramolecular organization observed in nature and present the first biomimetic material for proton transport out of which stable, oriented and self-sustained membranes could be prepared. As revealed by combined X-ray diffraction, Atomic Force Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy, polymeric column formation was obtained in the cast membranes following a thermally induced homeotropical orientation. Two unique and highly desired properties were found in the resulting membranes. While conventional proton conducting membranes exploit an “acidic group-based” transport mechanism, the current columns pillaring across the membranes formed ionic paths, giving rise to a remarkable size-dependent antiport transport mechanism. It resulted in conductivity values in the range of 10−2–10−3 S/cm, comparable to current state-of-the-art Nafion membranes, but, most importantly, with a complete independency from relative humidity. Reported membranes thus open excellent opportunities for further fine-tuning of their properties, wider exploitation of the exceptional transport mechanism, and final applications in fuel cells and related fields.},

	abstract = {We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Å, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Å, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Å and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

To our knowledge, this is one of the rare examples (if not the only example) of a Br?nsted acidic amphiphile capable of forming a high-curvature LLC phase.

	abstract = {HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a primary target for anti-AIDS drugs. Structures of HIV-1 RT, usually determined at [∼]2.5-3.0 A resolution, are important for understanding enzyme function and mechanisms of drug resistance in addition to being helpful in the design of RT inhibitors. Despite hundreds of attempts, it was not possible to obtain the structure of a complex of HIV-1 RT with TMC278, a nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI) in advanced clinical trials. A systematic and iterative protein crystal engineering approach was developed to optimize RT for obtaining crystals in complexes with TMC278 and other NNRTIs that diffract X-rays to 1.8 A resolution. Another form of engineered RT was optimized to produce a high-resolution apo-RT crystal form, reported here at 1.85 A resolution, with a distinct RT conformation. Engineered RTs were mutagenized using a new, flexible and cost effective method called methylated overlap-extension ligation independent cloning. Our analysis suggests that reducing the solvent content, increasing lattice contacts, and stabilizing the internal low-energy conformations of RT are critical for the growth of crystals that diffract to high resolution. The new RTs enable rapid crystallization and yield high-resolution structures that are useful in designing/developing new anti-AIDS drugs.},

Compact conformations in general have small MOs, whereas some extended conformations have MO as high as 35\%, strongly suggesting these conformations to be most abundant in solution. The method is universally applicable as it requires only standard SAXS data and specific NMR data on lanthanide derivatives of the protein (using native metal sites or lanthanide tagging).

Here we report facile, scalabe fabrication of polymer membranes with vertically (i.e., along the through-plane direction) aligned 1 nm pores by magnetic-field alignment and subsequent cross-linking of a liquid crystalline mesophase. We utilize a wedge-shaped amphiphilic species as the building block of a thermotropic columnar mesophase with 1 nm ionic nanochannels, and leverage the magnetic anisotropy of the amphiphile to control the alignment of these pores with a magnetic field. In situ X-ray scattering and subsequent optical microscopy reveal the formation of highly ordered nanostructured mesophases and cross-linked polymer films with orientational order parameters of ca. 0.95. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging provides direct visualization of long-range persistence of vertically aligned, hexagonally packed nanopores in unprecedented detail, demonstrating high-fidelity retention of structure and alignment after photo-cross-linking. Ionic conductivity measurements on the aligned membranes show a remarkable 85-fold enhancement of conductivity over nonaligned samples. These results provide a path to achieving the large area control of morphology and related enhancement of properties required for high-performance membranes and other applications.},

At certain conditions the fluid inside and outside the nanoporous material can be viewed as a two-phase system, with an interface between them, which poses an excess resistance to matter flow. We show that there exist two kinds of phenomena which influence the interfacial resistance: hydrodynamic effects and thermodynamic effects, which are independent of each other. Here, we investigate the role of the thermodynamic effects in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and slit pores and compare the associated thermodynmic resistance with that due to hydrodynamic effects traditionally modeled by the established Sampson expression. Using CH4 and CO2 as model fluids, we show that the thermodynamic resistance is especially important for moderate to high pressures, at which the fluid within the CNT or slit pore is in the condensed state. Further, we show that at such pressures the thermodynamic resistance becomes comparable with the internal resistance to fluid transport at length scales typical of membranes used in fuel cells, and of importance in membrane-based separation, and nanofluidics in general.},

Spectroscopic analysis indicates that these peptides do not self-sort and assemble into enantiomeric fibrils composed of all-L and all-D peptides, but rather coassemble into fibrils that contain alternating L- and D-peptides in a "rippled β-sheet" orientation. Isothermal titration calorimetry indicates an enthalpic advantage for rippled β-sheet coassembly compared to self-sorted β-sheet assembly of enantiomeric peptides.},

At these temperatures, extrinsic defects were found to be prerequisite for diffusion of fluorine ions. During defect-free simulations, intrinsic disorder was not generated spontaneously. Fluorine migration procedes via a discrete vacancy “hopping” mechanism, in which the anion migration time is of at least an order of magnitude less than the average residence time at a given lattice site.

Their potential to enhance viscoelasticity by anisotropic micellar growth upon salt addition was compared in terms of (i) the influence of the headgroup structure, and (ii) the influence of surfactant counterion type. Employing proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), we focused on the molecular conformation of surfactant monomers in the core and polar shell regions of the micelles and their interactions with increasing concentration of NaSal. The viscoelastic response was investigated by rotational and oscillatory rheology. We show that micellar growth rates can be tuned by varying the flexibility and size of the surfactant headgroup as well as the dissociation degree of the surfactant counterion, which directly influences the strength of headgroup?counterion pairing. As a consequence, the morphological transitions depend directly on charge neutralization by electrostatic screening. For example, the amount of salt necessary to start the rodlike-to-wormlike micelle growth depends directly on the number of dissociated counterions in the polar shell.},

	abstract = {Biofilms cause persistent bacterial infections and are extremely recalcitrant to antimicrobials, due in part to reduced penetration of antimicrobials into biofilms that allows bacteria residing in the depth of a biofilm to survive antimicrobial treatment. Here, we describe the preparation of surface-adaptive, Triclosan-loaded micellar nanocarriers showing (1) enhanced biofilm penetration and accumulation, (2) electrostatic targeting at acidic pH toward negatively charged bacterial cell surfaces in a biofilm, and (3) antimicrobial release due to degradation of the micelle core by bacterial lipases. First, it was established that mixed-shell-polymeric-micelles (MSPM) consisting of a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-shell and pH-responsive poly(?-amino ester) become positively charged at pH 5.0, while being negatively charged at physiological pH. This is opposite to single-shell-polymeric-micelles (SSPM) possessing only a PEG-shell and remaining negatively charged at pH 5.0. The stealth properties of the PEG-shell combined with its surface-adaptive charge allow MSPMs to penetrate and accumulate in staphylococcal biofilms, as demonstrated for fluorescent Nile red loaded micelles using confocal-laser-scanning-microscopy. SSPMs, not adapting a positive charge at pH 5.0, could not be demonstrated to penetrate and accumulate in a biofilm. Once micellar nanocarriers are bound to a staphylococcal cell surface, bacterial enzymes degrade the MSPM core to release its antimicrobial content and kill bacteria over the depth of a biofilm. This constitutes a highly effective pathway to control blood-accessible staphylococcal biofilms using antimicrobials, bypassing biofilm recalcitrance to antimicrobial penetration.},

	abstract = {We investigate the fundamental factors controlling polymorphism in 5-fluorouracil by performing molecular dynamics simulations of solutions of the compound in water, nitromethane, and wet nitromethane. Analysis of the effect of solvent on the initial aggregation of 5-fluorouracil molecules shows that the strong binding of water to the 5-fluorouracil molecule hinders the formation of the doubly hydrogen-bonded dimer and, by default, promotes close hydrophobic F···F interactions that are a feature of the unusual (Z‘ = 4) structure of form I. In contrast, doubly hydrogen-bonded dimers are observed to form readily in solution in dry nitromethane, consistent with the crystallization of the doubly hydrogen-bonded ribbon structure of form II from this solvent. When nitromethane is doped with water, the water forms hydrogen bonds to the solute, interfering with the formation of the doubly hydrogen-bonded dimers, which is consistent with the crystallization of form I from this hygroscopic solvent when it is not dried. Overall, the molecular dynamics simulations provide an atomistic picture of how solvent−solute interactions can significantly affect the initial association of 5-fluorouracil molecules to the extent that they determine the polymorphic outcome of the crystallization.},
