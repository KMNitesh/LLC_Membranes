Nanoporous membranes synthesized using the cross-linked inverted hexagonal
phase formed by self-assembled lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) are promising
materials for selective separations. The uniform-sized pores

enforce a strict molecular weight cut-off 
while functional groups densely occupy the pore
interiors and interact with charged and polar solutes. Currently, we lack the
molecular-level understanding necessary in order to controllably design these
membranes for solute-specific separations. 

We have created an atomistic
molecular model that is maximally consistent with experimental X-ray
diffraction data in order to study solute transport within the membrane
nanopores. In this work, we observe transport of water, sodium ions and

small polar solutes within the pores of our model. The membrane's inhomogeneous
composition gives rise to radially dependent transport mechanisms with respect
to the pore centers. In general, we observe that all solutes perform
intermittent hops between lengthy periods of entrapment. Three different
trapping mechanisms are responsible for this behavior. First, solutes that
drift out of the pore can become entangled among the dense monomer tails.
Second, solutes can donate hydrogen bonds to the monomer head groups. Third,
solutes can coordinate with sodium counter ions. The degree to which a solute
is affected by each mechanism is dependent on the chemical functionality of the
solute. Ultimately, we can use the insights developed in this study in order
to redesign existing LLC membranes in order to perform solute-specific
separations.
