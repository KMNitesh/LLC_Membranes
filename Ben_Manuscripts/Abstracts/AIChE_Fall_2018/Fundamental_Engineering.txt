# Fundamental Research in Transport Processes

Session Description: 

This session supports fundamental research in all manner of transport
processes. Both experimental and theoretical investigations are welcome.
Special consideration is given to work on coupled transport processes that may
not be adequately served by other, more focused sessions

Title : Understanding transport of small solutes in the pores of a
nanostructured lyotropic liquid crystal membrane

Lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) are amphiphilic molecules that have the ability to
form ordered nanostructures. When combined with ~10 wt % water, the liquid
crystalline monomer, NA-GA3C11, forms the inverted hexagonal (HII) phase which
is characterized by uniform-sized, sub-nm, straight hydrophilic pores. This
geometry is ideal for transport in aqueous membrane separation processes. With a
complete understanding of the mechanisms that govern transport of small
solutes within these nanopores, we can modify LLC monomers in order to tune
the size and chemical environment of the pores for solute-specific separations.

We have used molecular dynamics simulations in order to form a detailed
atomistic model of this system by maximizing its consistency with experimental
observables such as 2D wide angle X-ray scattering patterns and ionic
conductivity measurements. Using our atomistically detailed model, we study the
transport mechanisms of a range of neutral solutes within the pores. We
measure the mean square displacement (MSD) of each molecule in order to
understand each solute's diffusive behavior in the pores versus in bulk. We
calculate the diffusion constant along the pore for each solute, and examine
transport mechanisms as the rates of diffusion change. We also calculate the
potential of mean force (PMF) using umbrella sampling to construct free energy
profiles along the pore. We use this information to understand selectivity
based on both size and chemical details of the solute. With this
understanding, we can identify bottlenecks in membrane design so that we can
suggest new LLC monomer structures to be tested experimentally.
