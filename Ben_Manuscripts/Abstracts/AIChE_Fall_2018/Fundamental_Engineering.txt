# Fundamental Research in Transport Processes

Session Description: 

This session supports fundamental research in all manner of transport
processes. Both experimental and theoretical investigations are welcome.
Special consideration is given to work on coupled transport processes that may
not be adequately served by other, more focused sessions

Title : Understanding transport of small solutes in the pores of a
crosslinked hexagonal phase lyotropic liquid crystal membrane

Lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) are amphiphilic molecules with the ability to
form ordered nanostructures. When combined with ~10 wt % water, the liquid
crystalline monomer, NA-GA3C11, forms the inverted hexagonal (HII) phase which
is characterized by uniform-sized, sub-nm, straight hydrophilic pores. This
geometry is ideal for transport in aqueous membrane separation processes. With a
complete understanding of the mechanisms that govern transport of small
solutes within these nanopores, we can modify LLC monomers in order to tune
the size and chemical environment of the pores for solute-specific separations.
Previously, we have used molecular dynamics simulations in order to form a
detailed atomistic model of this system by maximizing its consistency with
experimental observables such as 2D wide angle X-ray scattering patterns and
ionic conductivity measurements. Using our detailed model we study the
transport mechanisms of a range of neutral solutes within the pores. We measure
the mean square displacement (MSD) of each molecule in order to understand each
solute's diffusive behavior in the pores versus in bulk. We run potential of
mean force (PMF) simulations in conjuction with umbrella sampling in order to
construct free energy profiles as we pull each solute through the pores. We use
this information to identify bottlenecks in membrane design that limit its
permeance and selectivity towards solutes and suggest new LLC monomer
structures to be tested experimentally.
