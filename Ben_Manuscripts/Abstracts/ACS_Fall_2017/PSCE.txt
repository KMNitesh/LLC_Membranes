Nanostructured membranes offer the ability to control pore architecture
at the atomic lengthscale. Lyotropic liquid crystals (LLC) are a class 
of nanostructured materials that can be modified, assembled and 
crosslinked into stable membranes with uniform straight pores which can
perform solute specific separations. Pore diameters on the order of 1 nm
make LLC membranes well suited for aqueous separations such as desalination 
and biorefinement. To advance our knowledge of transport in these systems,
thus teaching us how to better design monomers, we have studied an
experimentally known system using molecular dynamics simulations in order 
to develop a predictive model for membrane design. To date, our focus has
been on creating a molecular model which is consistent with experimentally
measured structural features and material properties as well as studying
solute transport in through the pores. We have developed methods to simulate
the crosslinking mechanism, simulate X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and to
measure ionic conductivity from atomistic simulations. Simulating X-ray
diffraction patterns has enhanced our understanding of the system's
microscopic structure. By matching simulated and experimental 2D WAXS patterns,
we have discovered an additional metastable state, mainly characterized
by its pore structure, which may form under certain experimental conditions.
The first state has a condensed, narrow pore with high radial disorder.
Although stable, the XRD pattern does not match experimental results.
The second, whose XRD pattern gives a good match to experiment, is noticeably
more open with aromatic rings stacked in a parallel displaced conformation.
The difference in pore structure will surely affect the mechanism by which
solutes diffuse across the membrane directly impacting macroscopic fluxes and

solute rejections. We compare transport in each configuration to see 
which will result in a high performance membrane. We examine transport of 
water, monovalent and divalent ions, and a range of small polar molecules
with a range of hydrodynamic radii. These studies provide a clear answer 
to which state should be synthesized. Our simulations can advise 
experimentalists on which synthetic conditions result in the desired state.
