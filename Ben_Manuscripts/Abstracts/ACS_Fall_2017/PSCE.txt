Nanostructured membranes offer the ability to control pore architecture
at the atomic length scale. Lyotropic liquid crystals (LLC) are a class 
of nanostructured materials that can be modified, assembled and 
crosslinked into stable membranes with uniform straight pores that can
perform solute-specific separations. Pore diameters on the order of 1 nm
make LLC membranes well-suited for aqueous separations such as desalination 
and biorefinement.  However, without a clear understanding of mechanisms 
of transport in these complex self-assembled systems, it is challenging to 
choose momoners to achieve specific separations goals. To advance our
knowledge of transport in these systems, we have studied an experimentally
characterized model system using molecular dynamics simulations in order 
to develop a predictive model for membrane design. We have created  
a molecular model which is maximally consistent with experimentally
measured structural features and material properties, and examined solute 
transport through the pores. We have developed methods to simulate
the crosslinking mechanism, simulate X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and to
measure ionic conductivity from atomistic simulations. By matching simulated
and experimental 2D WAXS patterns, we have discovered an additional metastable
state, mainly characterized by its pore structure, which may form under
certain experimental conditions. The first state has a condensed, narrow pore
with high radial disorder. Although stable out to 100's of nanoseconds, the
XRD pattern does not match experimental results. The second, whose XRD pattern
gives a good match to experiment, is noticeably more open with aromatic
rings stacked in a parallel displaced conformation. Other theorized pore
arrangements are not stable in simulation. The difference in pore structure  
affects the mechanism by which solutes diffuse across the membrane directly
impacting macroscopic fluxes and which will result in a high performance
membrane. We examine transport of water, monovalent and divalent ions,
and a range of small polar molecules with a range of hydrodynamic radii. 
These studies can help guide the choice of monomer for specific separations
objectives.
