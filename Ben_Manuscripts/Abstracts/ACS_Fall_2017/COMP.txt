Nanostructured membranes offer the ability to control pore architecture
at the atomic lengthscale. Lyotropic liquid crystals (LLC) are a class 
of nanostructured materials that can be modified, assembled and 
crosslinked into stable membranes with uniform straight pores that can
perform solute specific separations. Pore diameters on the order of 1 nm
make LLC membranes well-suited for aqueous separations such as desalination 
and biorefinement. For the first time, to our knowledge, a LLC system is
being studied atomistically using molecular dynamics simulations. An iterative
approach of simulation and experiment is being used to help us characterize
and reduce the large chemical design space available for LLC monomer design.
A properly conditioned model will provide a link between monomer structure and 
macroscopic separation performance. With a clear understanding of mechanisms of 
transport in these complex self-assembled systems, one can choose monomers
to achieve specific separation goals. To date, our focus has been on creating a 
molecular model which is consistent with experimentally measured structural 
features and material properties. To ensure agreement with experiment, we have
developed a method to simulate the crosslinking mechanism, a key step during 
synthesis. We have adopted and compared multiple methods for calculating ionic
conductivity from atomistic simulations. Simulated XRD patterns based on 
atomic coordinates generate 1D and 2D simulated XRD patterns containing all 
major features present experimentally. Using these methods to characterize 
the molecular model, we have discovered an additional metastable state which 
may form under certain experimental conditions. Each configuration gives 
different structural properties but persists for 100's of simulated nanoseconds.
%BJC: mention free energy calculations here? It seem that it is something we
% will be doing soon and would be of interest to people in this forum.
We have studied the transport of a range of solutes with various charges
and hydrodynamic radii. We can use this information to draw correlations 
between pore structure and selective preferences. These studies will help 
guide monomer choice for separation-specific objectives.
%BJC: I noticed in the session that there is an NVIDIA GPU poster award. Do
% you think it is worth having anything about how we ran the simulations?
