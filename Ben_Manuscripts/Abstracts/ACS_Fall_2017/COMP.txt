For the first time, to our knowledge, a lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC)
system is studied atomistically using molecular dynamics simulations.
LLC's are a class of nanostructured materials that can be modified,
assembled and crosslinked into stable membranes with uniform straight
pores that can perform solute specific separations and offer the
ability to control pore architecture at the atomic lengthscale.  Pore
diameters on the order of 1 nm make LLC membranes well-suited for
aqueous separations such as desalination and biorefinement.
We have used an iterative approach of simulation and experiment to
help characterize and reduce the large chemical design space available
for LLC monomer design. A molecular model which is consistent with
experimentally measured structural features and material properties
can provide a link between monomer structure and macroscopic
separation performance. With a clear understanding of mechanisms of
transport in these complex self-assembled systems, one can choose
monomers to achieve specific separation goals. In our model, we have
developed a method to simulate the crosslinking mechanism, a key step
during synthesis. We have also adopted and compared multiple methods
for calculating ionic conductivity from atomistic simulations.
Simulated X-ray diffraction patterns based on atomic coordinates
generate 1D and 2D diffraction patterns containing all major features
present experimentally.

To generate robust statistics for each type of calculation, long
simulations, up to 1000 ns, must be run. Simulating the system of 66K 
atoms is facilitated by the use of NVIDIA Tesla K80 GPU accelerators.
Parallelization, with linear scaling up to 12 GPUs (6 K80 accelerators), 
yields 125 ns/day of simulation time.    

Using these methods to characterize the molecular model, we have
discovered an additional metastable state which may form under certain
experimental conditions. Each configuration gives different structural
properties but persists for 100's of simulated nanoseconds.

We have also studied the transport of a range of solutes with various
charges and hydrodynamic radii. We can use this information to draw
correlations between pore structure and selective preferences. These
studies will help guide monomer choice for separation-specific
objectives.
