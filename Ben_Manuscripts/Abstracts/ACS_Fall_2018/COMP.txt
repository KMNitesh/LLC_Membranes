We study a lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) system atomistically using molecular
dynamics simulations. LLC's are a class of nanostructured materials that can
be modified, assembled and crosslinked into stable membranes with uniform
straight pores that can perform solute specific separations and offer the
ability to control pore architecture at the atomic lengthscale. Pore diameters
on the order of 1 nm make LLC membranes well-suited for aqueous separations
such as desalination and biorefinement. A molecular model which is consistent
with experimentally measured structural features and material properties can
provide a link between monomer structure and macroscopic separation
performance. We have used simulations with experimental data to create such a
model. We have studied the transport rates within the membrane pores of a range
of solutes with various charges and hydrodynamic radii. With a clear
understanding of mechanisms of transport in these complex self-assembled
systems, one can choose monomers to achieve specific separation goals. We can
use this information to draw correlations between pore structure and selective
preferences. These studies will help guide monomer choice for
separation-specific objectives.
