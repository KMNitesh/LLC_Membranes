#MRS: NEED title?

#MRS: Should describe what was found and done (at least structurally)
  for the first part. Can talk about transport more vaguely, but could
  be more specific about what is being tested in the transport. 
#MRS: it will generally be accepted, though, as a poster.

We study a lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) system atomistically using molecular
dynamics simulations. LLC's are a class of nanostructured materials that can
be modified, assembled and crosslinked into stable membranes with uniform
straight pores that can perform solute specific separations and offer the
ability to control pore architecture at the atomic lengthscale. Pore diameters
on the order of 1 nm make LLC membranes well-suited for aqueous separations
such as desalination and biorefinement. 
%MRS: for example, describe what was found here more specifically.
A molecular model which is consistent
with experimentally measured structural features and material properties can
provide a link between monomer structure and macroscopic separation
performance. We have used simulations with experimental data to create such a
model. 

%MRS: be specific about what we plan to test.
We have studied the transport rates within the membrane pores of a
range of solutes with various charges and hydrodynamic radii. With a
clear understanding of mechanisms of transport in these complex
self-assembled systems, one can choose monomers to achieve specific
separation goals. We can use this information to draw correlations
between pore structure and selective preferences. These studies will
help guide monomer choice for separation-specific objectives.
