Nanostructured polymer membranes offer the ability to control pore architecture
at the atomic length scale. Lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) are a class of
nanostructured materials that can be modified, assembled and crosslinked into
stable membranes with uniform, straight pores that can perform solute-specific
separations. Pore diameters on the order of 1 nm make LLC membranes well-suited
for aqueous separations such as desalination and biorefinement. We use
atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in order to understand the mechanisms
of solute transport in these complex self-assembled systems so that we can
design these membranes to achieve specific separations goals. Our preliminary
results have shown that atomistic simulation produces metastable structures
dependent on one's choice of initial configuration. It is clear that without an
understanding of the nanoscopic structure of these membranes, we will not be
able to appropriately model the chemical environment present in the real
system. Fortunately, experimentalists have provided us with detailed 1D and 2D
small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS)
data. We calculated the structure factor of various metastable molecular
dynamics configurations as well as simplified models in order to understand
what real space structural features are responsible for the reciprocal space
features that we see in the X-ray diffraction patterns. We have also examined
correlation functions in real space to assess the degree of ordering in our
system and to compare it to experimentally measured values. Using our approach,
we have been able to construct a model that is maximally consistent with
experimental results and is therefore suitable to be studied in order to gain
insights about solute transport mechanisms.
