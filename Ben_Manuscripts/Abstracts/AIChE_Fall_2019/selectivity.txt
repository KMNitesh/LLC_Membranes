Nanoporous membranes created from the cross-linked inverted hexagonal phase of
self-assembled lyotropic liquid crystals show promise for selective
separations. Their pores' uniform size affords a strict molecular weight
cut-off and the functionality of consituent liquid crystal monomers allows
separation of solutes based not only size, but on chemical functionality of
solutes. We have used atomistic molecular simulations in order to understand
the complex mechanisms that govern transport of 20 different small polar
solutes inside the nanopores of atomistic representation of an LLC membrane.
The membrane's inhomogeneous composition gives rise to radially dependent
transport mechanisms, with respect to the pore centers. In general, we observed
that all solutes perform intermittent hops between lengthy periods of
entrapment. We explored three different trapping mechanisms which are
responsible for this behavior. First, solutes that drift out of the pore can
become entangled among the dense monomer tails. Second, solutes can donate
hydrogen bonds to the monomer head groups.  Third, solutes can coordinate with
sodium counter ions. The degree to which a solute is affected by each mechanism
is dependent on the chemical functionality of the solute. Using the insights
developed in our work, we can think more critically about how to redesign
existing LLC membranes in order to perform solute-specific separations.
