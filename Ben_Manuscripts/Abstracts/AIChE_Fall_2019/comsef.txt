Cross-linked inverted hexagonal phase lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) membranes
for pores of uniform size and complex chemical topology of the pores that 
%
make them promising for selective separations. 

We characterized transport of water, sodium ions and 20 small polar solutes within the pores of an LLC
membrane using atomistic molecular simulations. Due to the inhomogeneous pore
compostion, we observed radially dependent transport mechanisms that are a
strong function of solute chemical functionality. In general, 
all solutes perform intermittent hops between lengthy periods of entrapment.
Three different trapping mechanisms are responsible for this behavior. First,
solutes that drift out of the pore can become entangled among the dense monomer
tails. Second, solutes can donate hydrogen bonds to the monomer head groups.
Third, solutes can coordinate with sodium counter ions. The degree to which a
solute is affected by each mechanism is dependent on the chemical functionality
of the solute. We have used our detailed mechanistic understanding in order to
construct a stochastic model which we can use to project the long term behavior
of the solutes and ultimately predict selectivity. Using the insights developed
in this study, we can begin to think about how to redesign existing LLC
membranes in order to perform solute-specific separations.
