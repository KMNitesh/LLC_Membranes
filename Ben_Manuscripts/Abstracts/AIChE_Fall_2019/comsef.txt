The uniform size and complex chemical topology of the pores that constitute
cross-linked inverted hexagonal phase lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) membranes
make them promising for selective separations. We have observed transport of
water, sodium ions and 20 small polar solutes within the pores of an LLC
membrane using atomistic molecular simulations. We found that the transport
rate of a species is dependent not only on molecular size, but on chemical
functionality as well. Electrostatic interactions between
the membrane and solutes provide an interesting diversity of mechanistic
behaviors. In general, we observed that all solutes perform intermittent hops
between lengthy periods of entrapment. Three different trapping mechanisms are
responsible for this behavior. First, solutes that drift out of the pore can
become entangled among the dense monomer tails. Second, solutes can donate
hydrogen bonds to the monomer head groups. Third, solutes can coordinate with
sodium counter ions. The degree to which a solute is affected by each
mechanism is dependent on the chemical functionality of the solute. We have
used our detailed mechanistic understanding in order to construct a stochastic
model which we can use to project the long term behavior of the solutes and
ultimately predict selectivity. Using the insights developed in this study, we
can begin to think about how to redesign existing LLC membranes in order to
perform solute-specific separations.
