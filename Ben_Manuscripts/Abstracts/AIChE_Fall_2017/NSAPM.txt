Nanostructured membranes offer the ability to control pore architecture
at the atomic lengthscale. Self-assembled lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC)
membranes are a class of materials that can be easily modified to 
perform solute specific separations. HII phase LLC membranes are 
characterized by hexagonally packed, hydrophilic, aligned cylindrical pore 
regions. Pore diameters on the order of 1 nm make LLCs membranes well
suited for aqueous separations such as desalination and biorefinement.
