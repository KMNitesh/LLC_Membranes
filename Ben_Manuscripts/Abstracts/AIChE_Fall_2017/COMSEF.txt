For the first time, to our knowledge, a lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC)
system is studied atomistically using molecular dynamics simulations.
LLC's are a class of nanostructured materials that can be modified,
assembled and crosslinked into stable membranes with uniform straight
pores that can perform solute specific separations and offer the ability
to control pore architecture at the atomic lengthscale. Pore diameters
on the order of 1 nm make LLC membranes well-suited for aqueous
separations such as desalination and biorefinement. A molecular model
which is consistent with experimentally measured structural features
and material properties can provide a link between monomer structure and
macroscopic separation performance. We have used simulations with
experimental data to create such a model. In our model, we have 
developed a method to simulate the crosslinking mechanism, a key step
during synthesis. We have also adopted and compared multiple methods
for calculating ionic conductivity from atomistic simulations. Simulated
X-ray diffraction patterns based on atomic coordinates generate 1D and
2D diffraction patterns containing all major features present experimentally.
Using these methods to characterize the molecular model, we have discovered
an additional metastable state which may form under certain experimental
conditions. Each configuration gives different structural properties but
persists for 100's of simulated nanoseconds. We have also studied the
transport of a range of solutes with various charges and hydrodynamic
radii. With a clear understanding of mechanisms of transport in these
complex self-assembled systems, one can choose monomers to achieve
specific separation goals. We can use this information to draw
correlations between pore structure and selective preferences. These
studies will help guide monomer choice for separation-specific objectives.
