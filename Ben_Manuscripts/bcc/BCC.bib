	abstract = {The impact of pore geometry and functionality on the dynamics of water nanoconfined in porous media are the subject of some debate. We report the synthesis and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) characterization of a series of perdeuterated gemini surfactant lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs), in which convex, water-filled nanopores of well-defined dimensions are lined with carboxylate functionalities. Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements of the translational water dynamics in these dicarboxylate LLC nanopores as functions of the surfactant hydration state and the charge compensating counterion (Na+, K+, NMe4+) reveal that the measured dynamics depend primarily on surfactant hydration, with an unexpected counterion dependence that varies with hydration number. We rationalize these trends in terms of a balance between counterion–water attractions and the nanopore volume excluded by the counterions. On the basis of electron density maps derived from SAXS analyses of these LLCs, we directly show that the volume excluded by the counterions depends on both their size and spatial distribution in the water-filled channels. The translational water dynamics in the convex pores of these LLCs are also slower than those reported in the concave pores of AOT reverse micelles, implying that water dynamics also depend on the nanopore curvature.},

	abstract = {The synthesis and lyotropic liquid-crystalline (LLC) phase behavior of a homologous series of intrinsically cross-linkable gemini surfactants are described. These novel bis(alkyl-1,3-diene)-based phosphonium gemini amphiphiles exhibit “normal” hexagonal (HI), Type I bicontinuous cubic (QI), and lamellar (Lα) phases in water, and can be photocross-linked with retention of phase architecture in each case. On the basis of their locations on the phase diagram, their powder X-ray diffraction profiles, and the physical properties of the cross-linked materials, the QI phases formed by these gemini monomers are consistent with four possible bicontinuous cubic architectures with P or I space group symmetry that have been identified previously for small molecule amphiphiles. The extent of polymerization (i.e., the degree of diene conversion) achieved in the LLC phases was determined to be in the 23\% to 71\% range using UV−vis spectrometry, which is more than sufficient to extensively stabilize the systems. The resulting cross-linked HI, Lα, and QI phases are stable up to 300 °C in air. To our knowledge, these reactive amphiphiles constitute the first example of a polymerizable gemini surfactant, and the first example of a cross-linkable amphiphile system that can be polymerized in both the HI and a QI mesophase with retention of phase microstructure.},

	abstract = {Water-mediated ion transport through functional nanoporous materials depends on the dynamics of water confined within a given nanostructured morphology. Here, we investigate H-bonding dynamics of interfacial water within a “normal” (Type I) lyotropic gyroid phase formed by a gemini dicarboxylate surfactant self-assembly using a combination of 2DIR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that water dynamics in the normal gyroid phase is 1 order of magnitude slower than that in bulk water, due to specific interactions between water, the ionic surfactant headgroups, and counterions. Yet, the dynamics of water in the normal gyroid phase are faster than those of water confined in a reverse spherical micelle of a sulfonate surfactant, given that the water pool in the reverse micelle and the water pore in the gyroid phase have roughly the same diameters. This difference in confined water dynamics likely arises from the significantly reduced curvature-induced frustration at the convex interfaces of the normal gyroid, as compared to the concave interfaces of a reverse spherical micelle. These detailed insights into confined water dynamics may guide the future design of artificial membranes that rapidly transport protons and other ions.},

A united atom model is employed for the surfactants with fully atomistic counterions and water. This gemini architecture, in which two single tailed surfactants are joined through a flexible hydrophobic linker, has been shown to exhibit concentration-dependent aqueous self-assembly into lyotropic phases including hexagonal, gyroid, and lamellar morphologies. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed phases at similar amphiphile concentrations in water, including the unusual ability of these surfactants to form gyroid phases over unprecedentedly large amphiphile concentration windows. We demonstrate quantitative agreement between the predicted and experimentally observed domain spacings of these nanostructured materials. Through careful conformation analyses of the surfactant molecules, we show that the gyroid phase is electrostatically stabilized related to the lamellar phase. By starting with a lamellar phase, we show that use of a bulkier N(CH3)4+ counterion in place of Na+ drives the formation of a gyroid phase. Decreasing the charge on the surfactant headgroups by carboxylate protonation decreases the degree of order in the lamellar phase. Using our models, we show that the translational diffusion of water and the Na+ counterions is decreased by several orders of magnitude over the studied concentration range, and we attribute these effects to strong correlations between the mobile species and the surfactant headgroups.},

The question of bicontinuity of noncubic mesophases, including some hexagonal and intermediate phases, remains open. Recent work has focused on the nature of phase transformations involving bicontinuous mesophases, leading to some understanding of the energetics that govern mesophase stability, and locations (if any) of neutral surfaces in swelling bilayers. Further advances await, regarding detailed probes of the topological ‘defect’ density in these systems, including channels and pores within the bilayer membrane. In addition to basic physical understanding of lyotropic mesomorphism, probes of topology are required to sort out differences between novel mesoporous solids, often templated using lyotropic liquid crystals. There is evidence for a bicontinuous morphology in ‘folded sheet materials’ derived from kanemite.},

	abstract = {Of the six cubic phases identified so far in lipid-containing systems, the structures of only two have been determined unambiguously. We tackle the structure determination of the other four. We use for that purpose a novel pattern recognition approach, which consists of generating all the sets of phase angles (φ-sets) compatible with the observed reflections, and of screening them in a search for the “best” one. Two criteria are used for screening: both involve the parameter 〈(Δρ)4〉 (Δρ is a dimensionless function proportional to the Fourier transform of the set of observed structure factors). One is a test of smoothness, based upon the postulate that the “best” φ-set is that whose 〈(Δρ)4〉 is minimum; this criterion, equivalent to maximum entropy, is fulfilled when the system is devoid of heavy atoms, and when the polar and the hydrocarbon moieties occupy almost equal volumes. The other criterion is based upon the notion that 〈(Δρ)4〉 takes the same (or similar) values in thermodynamic phases with the same (or similar) chemical composition, whatever the structure of the phases. The validity of the two criteria is verified using numerous examples. The six cubic phases are analysed using this approach. The structure of three of them (Q230, Q224, Q229) can be described in terms of two three-dimensional networks of connected rods, mutually intertwined and unconnected: in Q230 the rods are coplanarly joined 3 by 3; in Q224 the rods are tetrahedrally joined 4 by 4; in Q229 the rods are cubically joined 6 by 6. The structures of Q212 and Q227 are related to those of Q230 and Q224, respectively; one of the two networks of rods is preserved, the other is replaced by a lattice of closed micelles. The structure of Q223 appears to consist of a cage-like continuous three-dimensional network of connected globules, coplanarly joined 3 by 3 at one end and 4 by 4 at the other, enclosing a three-dimensional lattice of closed micelles. The analogies of the structures of Q230, Q224, Q229 with the three fundamental cubic infinite periodic minimal surfaces are discussed. More interestingly, the structures of, on the one hand Q230, Q224, Q229 and of Q212, Q227, Q223 on the other, are shown to provide topological generalizations of the two paradigms of lipid organization; namely, the bilayer and the monolayer. These, and other structural aspects of the cubic phases are discussed in relation with some physical properties of lipids (for example, in microemulsions) and with their biological role (for example, the digestion of fats and the structure of the plasma membranes of some thermophilic archaebacteria).},

We find that a gradual increase in amphiphile concentration slows down domain growth, initially from algebraic to logarithmic temporal dependence, and, at higher concentrations, from logarithmic to stretched-exponential form. In growth-arrested stretched-exponential regimes, at late times we observe the self-assembly of sponge mesophases and gyroid liquid-crystalline cubic mesophases, hence confirming that (a) amphiphile-amphiphile interactions need not be long-ranged in order for periodically modulated structures to arise in a dynamics of competing interactions, and (b) a chemically specific model of the amphiphile is not required for the self-assembly of cubic mesophases, contradicting claims in the literature. We also observe a structural order-disorder transition between sponge and gyroid phases driven by amphiphile concentration alone or, independently, by the amphiphile-amphiphile and the amphiphile-binary fluid coupling parameters. For the growth-arrested mesophases, we also observe temporal oscillations in the structure function at all length scales; most of the wave numbers show slow decay, and long-term stationarity or growth for the others. We ascribe this behavior to a combination of complex amphiphile dynamics leading to Marangoni flows.},
