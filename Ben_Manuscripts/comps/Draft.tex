  \section{State of the Art}\label{section:state-of-the-art}

  \subsection*{Commercial Membranes for Small Molecule Separations}
  
  More highly selective nanoporous membranes could be useful for 
  performing complex aqueous separations with seawater and various
  sources of wastewater. For example, separating sodium chloride and 
  boron in seawater could yield potable drinking water in water scarce
  regions~\cite{fritzmann_state---art_2007} while separation of organic
  micropollutants found in municipal and industrial wastewaters could 
  make existing water supplies safer to drink~\cite{schwarzenbach_challenge_2006}.
  These represent only a few of the diverse contaminants of water sources~\cite{singh_production_2009,liu_removal_2008}. 
  By efficiently separating contaminants from feed solutions with
  highly selective membranes, it is possible to reduce the number of 
  required membrane passes and post-treatment steps needed for a given 
  filtration process~\cite{werber_materials_2016}, thus lowering energy 
  requirements and cost. Additionally, one can extract valuable
  resources from the feed streams~\cite{sales_resource_2015}. For example,
  flowback water produced during hydraulic fracturing of shale 
  formations contains dissolved species like acetate whose extraction has 
  economic value.~\cite{dischinger_application_2017,theodori_hydraulic_2014}

  Reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF) are two prevailing commercial
  membrane filtration processes that can be used to separate solutes on the 
  order of 1 nm in size and smaller, including ions. Both apply hydraulic 
  pressure to the feed solution in order to overcome osmotic pressure and 
  force water and unfiltered components through the membrane. RO membranes
  are typically thin film composite with a porous mechanical support layer
  and a thin but dense polymer matrix active layer where separation occurs.~\cite{jeong_interfacial_2007}
  RO separates solutes based on the solute's ability to dissolve into and 
  diffuse through the tortuous pathways available in the membrane's dense 
  active layer. RO offers high selectivity at the cost of relatively high 
  energy requirements since one must apply hydraulic pressure on the order of
  50--100 bar to the feed solution in order to achieve an economical flux.~\cite{van_der_bruggen_review_2003}
  In contrast to RO membranes, NF membranes have explicit pores on the order
  of 1 nm in size. Typically, separations are achieved based on size exclusion
  and Donnan exclusion if the membrane's surface has a net charge.~\cite{donnan_theory_1995}
  NF membranes require significantly less applied pressure in order to achieve
  solute flux comparable to RO. Unfortunately, conventional NF membrane synthesis
  processes, such as phase-inversion\cite{smolders_microstructures_1992}, are 
  stochastic in nature which yields pores that are polydisperse in size.~\cite{werber_materials_2016}
  Pore size polydispersity is detrimental to membrane selectivity.
  
  The downfall of traditional RO and NF membranes can be summarized by the well-known
  permeability-selectivity tradeoff. Namely, it is difficult to increase the
  permeability of a desired molecular or atomic species, while maintaining
  the same retention of undesired species.\cite{werber_materials_2016}  
  
  \subsection*{Nanostructured Membranes}
  
  Nanostructured membranes attempt to overcome the permeability-selectivity 
  tradeoff through intelligent design at the molecular level. Ultrathin-film
  graphene and graphene oxide membranes are an active area of research because
  they are atomically thick and therefore offer potential for extremely high
  permeability membranes.~\cite{humplik_nanostructured_2011} However, scalable
  synthesis without introducing microscopic, performance degrading defects has
  not yet been achieved.~\cite{cohen-tanugi_multilayer_2016,wei_multilayered_2018}
  Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have shown promise as aqueous separations membranes
  due to unprecedentedly fast water transport.\cite{humplik_nanostructured_2011,hummer_water_2001} 
  Practically, dispersing and aligning CNTs into a polymer matrix is extremely
  difficult because they tend to agglomerate due to Van der Waals forces.~\cite{sahoo_polymer_2010}
  Finally, zeolite-coated ceramic membranes offer the potential for permeabilities
  comparable to ultrafiltration, molecular sieves with pores up to 100 nm in 
  size~\cite{werber_materials_2016}, with selectivities as good as NF and RO. 
  A number of studies have tested the permeability and sodium salt rejection
  of various zeolite membranes, however none have fully overcome the 
  permeability-selectivity tradeoff.~\cite{pendergast_review_2011,auerbach_handbook_2003,li_novel_2007}

  \subsection*{Lyotropic Liquid Crystal Membranes}
  
  Preliminary evidence has shown that cross-linked lyotropic liquid crystal
  (LLC) membranes can be produced at moderate scale and may be capable of 
  performing highly selective separations~\cite{zhou_supported_2005,zhou_new_2007}. 
  LLCs are amphiphilic molecules that have the ability to self-assemble into
  porous nanostructures~\cite{smith_ordered_1997} that can be cross-linked 
  to create mechanically strong membrane films with periodic uniform-sized
  pores on the order of 1 nm in diameter~\cite{zhou_supported_2005}. 
  Since LLC polymer membranes have a very narrow pore size distribution, they 
  inherently exhibit high selectivity due to their molecular weight cut-off 
  (MWCO)~\cite{zhou_supported_2005}. Additionally, LLC monomers can be salts,
  and therefore lead to Donnan exclusion of ions at the membrane-feed solution 
  interface.\cite{donnan_theory_1995}
%    The membrane gains a net surface charge when counterions from
%  the head groups that line the pore walls escape into the feed solution in an
%  effort to balance the gradients of concentration and electric potential
%  \cite{donnan_theory_1995}.

  The feasibility of nanostructured LLC polymer membranes for selective 
  separations has been demonstrated using LLC monomers that form the type
  1 bicontinuous cubic (Q\textsubscript{I})~\cite{hatakeyama_water_2011,hatakeyama_nanoporous_2010,carter_glycerol-based_2012}
  and the inverted hexagonal (H\textsubscript{II}) phases (see 
  Figure~\ref{fig:structures}).~\cite{zhou_supported_2005} When separating
  organic solutes from NaCl, Q\textsubscript{I}-phase membrane filtration 
  experiments have shown selectivity 2--3 times higher than commercial RO
  and 6--12 times higher than commercial NF membranes.~\cite{dischinger_application_2017}
  When separating a series of various sized dyes, an H\textsubscript{II}-phase 
  LLC membrane showed complete rejection of dyes bigger than 1.2 nm in size.~\cite{zhou_supported_2005}

  \end{figure}

  Q\textsubscript{I}-phase membranes consist of a tortuous network of three
  dimensionally interconnected pores that prevent optimal through-plane
  transport. In contrast, the densely packed, non-tortuous and uniform sized
  pores of H\textsubscript{II}-phase membranes represent the ideal geometry
  for achieving high solute flux\cite{matyka_tortuosity-porosity_2008}. However,
  the hexagonally packed LC domains of the H\textsubscript{II}-phase are generally
  unaligned, which hurts membrane permeability. This domain scale misalignment
  had inhibited further development of this technology, and research efforts were
  focused on the Q\textsubscript{I} phase, whose geometry does not require 
  alignment~\cite{zhou_new_2007}.

%  The H\textsubscript{II}-phase pore geometry (Figure~\ref{fig:assembly}) has a
%  high theoretical capacity for transport than the Q\textsubscript{I} phase.
%  \begin{itemize}
%	  \item The H\textsubscript{II} phase forms at room temperature in the 
%	  presence of ca.~10 wt\% water and consists of hexagonally packed, 
%	  hydrophilic pore columns\cite{smith_ordered_1997}. 
%%	  \item The hexagonal, straight-pore geometry provides a dense array
%%	  of hydrophilic channels and short pathways for solutes to travel.
%	  % BJC: should rethink the following since we think that thermotropic doesn't exist
%	  \item In the absence of water, neat monomer will form the same hexagonal
%	  columnar structure which, in the literature, has been referred to as the
%	  Col\textsubscript{h} thermotropic phase\cite{feng_scalable_2014}.
%  \end{itemize}

  Recently, researchers learned how to macroscopically align the hexagonal 
  domains which has revived research into H\textsubscript{II}-phase LLC
  polymer membranes. In 2014, Feng et al.~showed that one can align Col\textsubscript{h}
  domains, a temperature-dependent hexagonal phase created by neat LLC monomers,
  using a magnetic field with subsequent cross-linking to lock the structure 
  in place\cite{feng_scalable_2014}. In 2016, Feng et al.~showed that one could 
  also obtain the same result by confining the neat monomer between PDMS or glass 
  substrates since hexagonal mesophases preferentially anchor perpendicular to 
  both surfaces\cite{feng_thin_2016}.
  
  Unfortunately, reproducing the work of Feng et al. with the hydrated 
  H\textsubscript{II} phase has been an experimental challenge. Therefore, the
  primary focus of the most recent experimental research efforts has been 
  on the Q\textsubscript{I} phase.

  \section{Project Objectives}\label{section:objectives}  
  
  Our current understanding of the molecular details of LLC membranes'
  nanostructure is not sufficient to be able to precisely design them for
  specific separations. Dischinger et al.~attempted to use an empirical model
  that correlates the physicochemical properties of the counterion used in a
  Q\textsubscript{I}-phase LLC membrane to solute rejection. Although there was
  some agreement with their empirical model, it does not offer a sufficiently
  detailed explanation of the critical molecular interactions leading to the
  observed behavior.~\cite{dischinger_effect_2017} H\textsubscript{II}-phase LLC
  polymer membrane studies have been limited primarily to the Na-GA3C11 monomer
  (Figure~\ref{fig:HII_mon}) with some characterization done after minor monomer
  structural modifications.  These studies emphasized large scale structural
  features such as pore spacing as well as size-based
  rejection.~\cite{zhou_supported_2005,resel_structural_2000} Given the similar
  topology of H\textsubscript{II} and Q\textsubscript{I} membrane pores, we
  expect the H\textsubscript{II} phase will also be subject to complex
  solute-membrane interactions that are not easily explained by an empirical
  model.

  A molecular-level understanding of structure and transport in LLC polymer 
  membranes, enabled by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, can provide 
  guidelines to reduce the large chemical space available to design
  monomers for creation of separation-specific membranes. Using a sufficiently
  accurate molecular model, we can observe transport of solutes within LLC 
  membrane nanopores with atomistic resolution and infer mechanisms. 
  Based on this information we will have a much greater capability to 
  intelligently design new membranes by screening new liquid crystal monomer
  designs with MD simulations. The principles learned can be implemented 
  and tested experimentally.
  
  There are four primary objectives of this PhD research which are 
  at various stages of completion.

  \begin{enumerate}
  
    \item Develop techniques to build and understand the nanoscopic structure
    of H\textsubscript{II} LLC membranes. (\textcolor{green!40!olive}{\textbf{Complete}})

    A useful molecular-level model should incorporate a detailed picture 
    of the nanoscopic pore structure, which is crucial to understanding
    the role of monomer structure in solute transport and membrane design.
    Therefore, we must first create an atomistic model that is maximally 
    consistent with experimental structural data. It is also necessary to
    evaluate and justify the minimum effort required to build systems with
    alternate monomers while maintaining an experimentally-consistent 
    chemical environment. 
    
    \item Determine solute-membrane interactions that give rise to
    transport mechanisms. (\textcolor{green!40!olive}{\textbf{Complete}})
    
    Using my most experimentally consistent configuration, I can place 
    small molecules within the H\textsubscript{II} nanopores and observe
    their behavior over simulation-accessible timescales. This objective 
    aims to organize observations of various solute behaviors into
    distinct mechanisms that can help guide membrane design based on 
    chemical functionality of both solutes and LLC monomers.
    
    \item Create a stochastic model which can project long timescale 
    transport behavior. (\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{In Progress}})
    
    I will combine my qualitative knowledge of the solute transport mechanisms
    with simulation data in order to inform a stochastic model. This model
    should closely reproduce the properties of the time series that we observe 
    in our simulations. Due to the low computational cost of a stochastic model
    relative to MD simulations, I will be able to forecast long timescale transport
    behavior and make well-converged predictions of macroscopic transport properties.
           
    \item Adapt the analysis of Objectives 1--3 to the Q\textsubscript{I} phase. (\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{In Progress}})
    
    Over the course of this project, experimental research surrounding
    LLC membranes has shifted nearly all focus towards the Q\textsubscript{I}
    phase due to its more facile synthesis.	Although most of my work has 
    been applied to the H\textsubscript{II} phase, much of the same analyses
    can be applied to the Q\textsubscript{I} phase. The biggest challenge will
    be adapting my techniques to its more complex three dimensional geometry.
    
  \end{enumerate}

  \section{Progress to Date}\label{section:progress}
  
  \textbf{\large Objective 1:} {\large Build and understand the nanoscopic structure
  of the H\textsubscript{II} phase} (\textcolor{green!40!olive}{\textbf{Complete}})
  
  %BJC2: maybe a better way to present this
  \noindent My work fulfilling this objective is published in the Journal of Physical 
  Chemistry B: Coscia et al. \textit{J. Phys. Chem. B}, 123, 289-309 (2019).

  I developed a procedure for building and equilibrating an atomistic
  H\textsubscript{II} LLC membrane system (see Figure~\ref{fig:assembly}). I
  chose to build a monoclinic unit cell consisting of four pores. Each pore is
  composed of monomer columns, where each column consists of 20 monomers stacked
  on top of each other so that the phenyl groups are coplanar with each other and
  the $xy$ plane. The columns are oriented so that the hydrophilic monomer head
  groups face towards the pore center. Initially, I did not add any water to the starting 
  configuration because I compared the structure to experimental data for a
  system claimed to be synthesized with only neat monomer. 
  
  %BJC2: removing unnecessary details
%  I equilibrated unit cells using a series
%  of simulations with head groups held in place by position restraints, gradually
%  reducing the force constant of the position restraints until the system
%  was completely unrestrained. I let the system equilibrate for 400 ns of simulation
%  time.

  %MRS2: above: less detail on what you did (for example, 400 ns of equilibration); 
  %focus on the point of the experiments (whatt hypothesis was tested) and what the 
  %results are.  committee members are going to be less interested in the details 
  %than the intellectual framework being used.
  %BJC2: implementing this idea throughout

  I evaluated a number of different initial column architectures. I stacked 
  monomers in parallel displaced and sandwiched configurations, two possible
  $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking modes that might occur between monomer phenyl groups.
  ~\cite{sinnokrot_estimates_2002} I also varied the initial distance between
  stacked monomers, $d$. I chose $d$ values of 3.7~\AA, based on experimental
  WAXS measurements, as well as 5 \AA~as a test of its sensitivity.
  
  My model's geometry is most consistent with experiment for systems built
  with 5 columns per pore and monomers initially stacked 3.7 \AA~apart
  (see Figure~\ref{fig:p2p}). I equilibrated systems with 4, 5, 6, 7 and 
  8 columns per pore. The pore spacing of 5 column-per-pore systems agree
  well with experiment. 6 column-per-pore systems built with $d$ = 5 \AA~appear
  to yield an experimentally consistent pore spacing however, the equilibrated
  distance between stacked monomers stay close to 5 \AA~which is inconsistent
  with experiment. In general, the equilibrated distance between monomers stays
  close to its initial value.

            each pore increases.}~\label{fig:p2p}
    \vspace{-1.25cm}
  \end{wrapfigure}

  I further validated the structure of our molecular model by verifying 
  its consistency with five major reflections present in the experimental
  WAXS pattern. Using MD trajectories, I simulated X-ray diffraction (XRD)
  patterns that we could compare to the WAXS data by taking the appropriate
  cross-section of the time-averaged 3D structure factor. The five major 
  reflections and the structural features leading to them are summarized
  and described in the caption of Figure~\ref{fig:WAXS_comparison}. Note that
  none of the models simulated to this point could reproduce R-double.   
  
  It is necessary to add a small amount of water to the model in order to 
  fully reproduce all features of the WAXS pattern (see Figure~\ref{fig:solvated_XRD}).
  I obtain the most experimentally consistent structure when I build systems
  in the parallel displaced configuration with 1 wt\% water added to the pores. 
  This is the only configuration that gives rise to the R-double feature without
  imposing some kind of position restraint. R-double appears because 
  vertically adjacent monomer head groups hydrogen bond with shared water molecules,
  causing them to be drawn closer together. When multiple pairing interactions
  occur in series along the same pore axis, the center of masses of the pairs 
  are spaced apart at twice the $\pi$-stacking distance. The necessity of water
  in my model suggests that the membrane synthesized by Feng et al.
  ~\cite{feng_scalable_2014,feng_thin_2016} was slightly hydrated due to water 
  molecules leached from surroundings by the hydroscopic monomers. Similar 
  suspicions have been voiced by experimentalists in unpublished communications.

    \vspace{-0.75cm}
 \end{wrapfigure}
 
  My model exhibits slow dynamics on timescales longer than can be reasonably
  simulated with current computer resources. Consequently, there are very few
  uncorrelated frames in the trajectories which leads to noise and sharpened
  reflections in the simulated XRD patterns. One can overcome this issue by 
  combining the structure factors generated from an ensemble of simulated 
  trajectories each produced from an ensemble of uncorrelated initial 
  configurations. One can create decorrelated initial configurations by 
  randomly displacing monomer columns in the $z$-direction.
 
  Perhaps the most important conclusion from my structural work is that the 
  chemical composition of the pores is relatively insensitive to the initial 
  configuration. In Figure~\ref{fig:overlaid_densities}, I plot the radial 
  distribution function of various monomer components as a function of distance
  from the closest pore center. All are qualitatively similar meaning that a 
  solute placed in any of these systems should experience a similar chemical 
  environment. Although I will move forward with the most experimentally-consistent 
  configuration, this is an important finding since it implies that one does
  not need to apply the same level of rigor when screening new monomers.

  \noindent A manuscript based on the work presented towards this objective is under 
  review for publication in the Journal of Physical Chemistry B.

  I added additional water to the most experimentally consistent structural
  model in order to create a higher water content H\textsubscript{II} phase
  model. Researchers have synthesized the H\textsubscript{II} phase using 
  the NaGA3C11 monomer with water contents ranging from 7 - 20 wt\%, with 
  close to 10 wt\% being the most common.~\cite{smith_ordered_1997,zhou_supported_2005} 
  However, Resel et al. stated that the system is likely fully hydrated at
  7 wt \% water with excess water trapped in defects between hexagonal
  mesophases.~\cite{resel_structural_2000} Consequently, I chose to build
  two systems with 5 and 10 wt\% water.
  
  Upon simulating each system, I observed that water partitions into the
  distal tail region. Based on the radial distance from the pore center where 
  the minimum water density occurs, I defined the distal tail region to 
  be greater than 1.5 nm from any pore center. There is approximately a 3:2
  ratio of water in the pores to water in the distal tails. Due to the wedge
  shape of the monomers, the distal tail region has a relatively low density
  leaving space for water molecules to fill.

  (b) Monomers in the 10 wt \% system retreat an additional 0.2 nm to make room
  for more water. Water is densest at the pore center, but sodium ion density
  peaks closer to the head groups since many stay bound to carboxylate groups.}\label{fig:component_densities}
  \end{wrapfigure}
  
  The pores of the H\textsubscript{II} phase are a mixture of water, sodium
  ions and monomer head groups. Water is densest at the pore center ($r = 0$).
  The maximum density of head groups occurs 0.45 and 0.65 nm from the pore 
  center in the 5 and 10 wt\% water systems respectively (see 
  Figure~\ref{fig:component_densities}).
    
  Water and sodium transport is significantly faster in the less crowded 
  10 wt\% water pores. The mean squared displacement (MSD) of water is about
  51 times higher and the MSD of sodium is about 49 times higher compared to
  the 5 wt\% system. In general the solute transport mechanisms are similar
  in the 5 and 10 wt\% water systems but act on different time scales.
  
  I explored the influence of a solute's chemical functionality on its 
  transport properties within the H\textsubscript{II} nanopores.
  For each solute, I created a separate initial configuration and placed 6 
  solutes, equally spaced in $z$, in each nanopore. This gave a sufficient
  number of solute trajectories from which to generate statistics while 
  maintaining a low degree of interaction between solutes.

  The solute MSDs are not a monotonic function of solute size. In 
  Figures~\ref{fig:all_msds_5wt} and~\ref{fig:all_msds_10wt}, I plotted
  the average MSD of each solute. In Figures~\ref{fig:msd_radius_5wt} 
  and~\ref{fig:msd_radius_10wt}, I plotted the solute MSDs against their
  molecular radius. Also plotted are theoretical curves which illustrate the 
  expected MSD of each solute if they were to travel unhindered. The 
  Stokes-Einstein equation with the correction factor of Gierer and 
  Wirtz~\cite{gierer_molekulare_1953} passes through methanol's MSD and
  radius in order to give an approximate frame of reference. The correction 
  factor attempts to include the effects of microfriction that begin to 
  play a role when solute size becomes on the order of solvent size. 
  Since methanol is small, I assume that it travels unhindered relative 
  to all other solutes. The theoretical line serves as an approximate 
  boundary between subdiffusive, Brownian and superdiffusive behavior.
  In the majority of cases, solute MSDs fall well below the theoretical
  lines and therefore are subject to more hindrance than methanol due to
  factors other than size.

  Intermittent hops between long periods of entrapment lead to subdiffusive
  solute transport behavior. As implied by Figures~\ref{fig:msd_radius_5wt} and~\ref{fig:msd_radius_10wt}, 
  most solutes move significantly slower than expected. In 
  Figure~\ref{fig:example_ztraces}, I've plotted the $z$-direction trajectory
  of three ethanol molecules. Typically, long periods of entrapment occur
  when ethanol molecules are far from the pore center, while there is a much 
  greater degree of mobility close to the pore center. The MSD curve averaged
  over all ethanol trajectories is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:example_msd}.
  The curve is sub-linear and thus subdiffusive.

  In general, the longest dwell times occur when solutes are situated far from the
  pore center and the hops occur most frequently when solutes are close to the pore center. (b) The
  time-averaged MSD of ethanol is sub-linear which suggests transport is governed
  by an anomalous subdiffusion process.}\label{fig:qualitative_mechanisms}

  \end{wrapfigure}
  
  Due to the crowded environment among the monomer tails, solutes generally move
  faster in the less dense pore region. Figure~\ref{fig:hop_lengths} shows that 
  this is the case for all solutes. Hops made in the pore region are on average
  59 \% larger than those made outside the pore region.
  
  However, time spent in the pore region does not necessarily result
  in a high MSD. For example, ribose spends the largest fraction of time in 
  the pore region, but has the fifth lowest hop frequency and the third 
  lowest average MSD (see Figures~\ref{fig:frac_time} and~\ref{fig:hopfreq}).
  Therefore, proximity to the pore center cannot be the sole variable that
  determines transport properties.

  larger hops have higher MSDs. The fraction of time spent by a solute in the
  pore region (b) does not necessarily lead to more frequent hopping (c). For
  example, ribose spends the largest fraction of time in the pore region, yet
  performs the the fifth lowest number of hops and has the third lowest MSD.}\label{fig:hops}
  \end{figure}
  
  Among the set of solutes studied, we observe three different mechanisms 
  of entrapment that are responsible for subdiffusive behavior:
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item As already demonstrated by Figures~\ref{fig:example_ztraces} and 
    \ref{fig:hop_lengths}, solutes that drift away from the pore center
    can become entangled in the monomer tails. 
    \item Many of the solutes we studied are capable of donating hydrogen bonds to
    monomer head groups and thus are prone to temporary immobilization through 
    this interaction.
    \item Because all solutes are polar, they have regions of concentrated electron
    density, modeled as partial charges, which can associate with sodium ions
    bound to monomer head groups.
  \end{enumerate}

  bonds appears correlated to the percentage of solutes involved in hydrogen bond
  interactions. Hydrogen bond lifetimes tend to be longer for solutes that
  hydrogen bond frequently. Note that solutes incapable of donating hydrogen
  bonds are omitted from this figure.}\label{fig:hbonds}
  \vspace{-0.5cm}
  \end{wrapfigure}
  
  The frequency with which solutes donate hydrogen bonds to monomer head 
  groups is related to the number of hydrogen bond donating atoms as well
  as their identity. The percentage of solutes actively participating in
  at least one hydrogen bond with a head group each frame descends as the
  number of hydroxyl groups decreases (Figure~\ref{fig:nhbonds}). Solutes
  with many hydroxyl groups, such as ribose, tetrose and glycerol, can 
  donate multiple hydrogen bonds to monomer head groups simultaneously. 
  When one hydrogen bond is broken, other hydrogen bonds work to hold the
  solute in place, which allows broken hydrogen bonds to reform. Solutes 
  containing sulfur and nitrogen atoms in place of oxygen atoms hydrogen
  bond less frequently since they are less electronegative elements.~\cite{biswal_hydrogen_2015} % citation
  The lifetime of hydrogen bonds follows nearly the same trend 
  (Figure~\ref{fig:hbond_dwells}). Hydrogen bonds of solutes that hydrogen
  bond more frequently last longer.

  Solutes with carbonyl groups tend to associate with sodium ions most frequently.
  Nearly all of the most coordinated solutes contain a carbonyl group, except
  for DMSO which has an analogous sulfinyl group (see

  in sodium ion association for solutes that do not contain carbonyl groups or
  multiple hydroxyl groups to compensate. The corresponding dwell times 
  follow a similar trend, however the dwell times of highly coordinated solutes
  with multiple hydroxyl groups are generally lower since association between
  hydroxyl groups and sodium is apparently a weaker interaction 
  (Figure~\ref{fig:all_NA_dwells}). Solutes with nitrogen atoms adjacent to 
  the carbonyl groups tend to associate with sodium ions significantly more.

  lengths made by ethylene glycol appears Gaussian, which can be described by the
  maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the $\sigma$ parameter, with assumed mean,

  \noindent \textbf{\large Objective 3:} \textit{\large Create a stochastic model} (\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{In Progress}})
  
  While one can clearly learn a great deal of qualitative information about 
  mechanistic behavior on MD-accessible timescales, my work's impact would
  greatly increase if I could create a model that could predict macroscopic
  quantities such as permeability and selectivity within a reasonable degree
  of certainty. A stochastic model derived from simulation data could achieve 
  this however, there is not a well-defined procedure for this type of 
  extrapolation. Therefore, I am exploring two different approaches towards
  this end. 

  \begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.4\textwidth}
  \centering
  \vspace{-0.6cm}
  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{all_tamsds.pdf}
  \caption{The trends in the MSD calculated directly from MD simulations and from
  realizations of the sFBM process mostly agree, but the sFBM predictions are generally
  far too low.}\label{fig:sFBM_MSDs}
  \vspace{-0.5cm}
  \end{wrapfigure}

  \textit{Approach 1: subordinated fraction Brownian motion}: My first route 
  towards a stochastic model is to simulate realizations of a subordinated 
  fractional Brownian motion (sFBM) process based on parameters extracted 
  from solute time series. As demonstrated by the example in 
  Figures~\ref{fig:hop_dist} and~\ref{fig:dwell_dist}, the distribution of 
  hop lengths in the $z$-direction appear Gaussian while the distribution
  of dwell times between hops appears to be described by a power law. Alone,
  these distributions characterize a continuous time random walk (CTRW), 
  a subdiffusive process where particles hop a random distance in a random
  direction and stay there for a random period of time.~\cite{meroz_toolbox_2015}.
  Unlike a CTRW, the hops in the system I study appear anti-correlated to 
  their previous hop as demonstrated by the autocorrelation function in 
  Figure~\ref{fig:hop_acf}. A CTRW with anticorrelated hops is well-described
  by an sFBM process.~\cite{meroz_subdiffusion_2010} 
  
  Solute MSDs calculated based on realizations of an sFBM process mostly
  preserve the trends in MSD calculated directly from MD simulations (see
  Figure~\ref{fig:sFBM_MSDs}), but the predictions are generally too low. 
  For each solute, I used the parameters described in Figure~\ref{fig:distributions}
  to generate $1e4$ realizations of an sFBM process, each with the same
  length as the MD simulations (1000 ns) so that I could make a direct 
  comparison between their MSDs. While the sFBM MSD prediction for methanol
  is too high, the rest are on average only 46\% of the MD calculated MSD
  values.

  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{breakpoints.pdf}

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{In order to generate the parameters used in our first approach,
  I identified hops based on change points in the time series, indicated by
  color transitions. In addition to errors in change point detection, all 
  information between change points is lost.}\label{fig:ruptures}
  \vspace{-.5cm}
  \end{wrapfigure}  
  
  This approach might be improved by incorporating radial dependence into
  the three sFBM parameters described in Figure~\ref{fig:distributions}. 
  In Figure~\ref{fig:hop_lengths}, we showed that hops by solutes situated 
  inside the pores are 59\% larger than hops by solutes in the tails, which 
  leads to two distinct values of $\sigma$. Similarly, we can determine 
  radially dependent values of $\alpha$ and $H$. 
  
  A simple two state model, in pore versus out of pore, may be sufficient to 
  fully incorporate radially dependent effects. Based on the fraction of time 
  spent in the pore region (Figure~\ref{fig:frac_time}), we can determine
  the appropriate balance of each type of parameter to use when simulating sFBM
  realizations. We would also need some kind of switching frequency, or dwell
  time in each region since it does not make physical sense for a solute to 
  enter and exit the pore region every other time step.
  
  If the two state model proves insufficient, I can add increasing levels of
  complexity. For example, I might make the radial dependence a continuous 
  function, or I could assign parameters that are dependent on the type of
  trapping mechanism affecting the solute.
  
  It is important to note that this first approach does not use a significant
  fraction of the data. In order to construct distributions of hop lengths 
  and dwell times, I needed to locate precise time points at which hops 
  occurred. I achieved this using an off-line change point detection algorithm
  implemented in the python package \texttt{ruptures}.~\cite{truong_review_2018}
  The algorithm does a decent job of identifying hops, but still loses information
  as demonstrated in Figure~\ref{fig:breakpoints}. 

  \textit{Approach 2: Markov Switching Models}: Instead of limiting my 
  analysis to 3 fitting parameters ($\alpha$, $\sigma$ and $H$), my second
  approach uses all of the available data in order to classify sequences
  of time series behavior into distinct states. In 
  Figure~\ref{fig:markov_states_timeseries}, for demonstrative purposes,
  I've identified 3 potential states defined by the solute's behavior 
  during the time bounded by each box. Once we've identified states, we 
  can use our data to define a matrix of probabilities describing switches
  between states, following a Markovian framework (see Figure~\ref{fig:markov}).~\cite{howard_dynamic_1960}

  \caption{Using my second approach, I will be able to classify the behavior
  of solutes into distinct states. (a) As an example, I've come up with three
  potential states based on the time series pictured above. State 1: solutes
  far from the pore region are trapped in the tails leading to restricted 
  motion. State 2: unbound solutes within the pores make large and frequent
  movements. State 3: solutes are held in place by hydrogen bonds with monomer head groups
  (b) There is a probability associated with each transition between states, represented by the arrows above. For example, following
  the red arrows, there are probabilities associated with going from State 1 to
  State 2, from State 1 to State 3 and from State 1 back to State 1.

  \vspace{-.5cm}
  \end{figure}
  
  I will use the Kalman filter algorithm in order to identify distinct states
  in solute time series and simultaneously describe the dynamics of each state.~\cite{kalman_new_1960}
  In general, the Kalman filter can attempt to linearly project subsequent 
  steps in a time series based on its past values. The error in each prediction
  is stored sequentially. Regions of the time series associated with the 
  largest prediction uncertainties can be used as an indication of a state change.
  Using a non-parametric Bayesian approach to identify states, I will not need to 
  pre-define the number of states, which will allow the data to drive the
  model's complexity.~\cite{lee_unraveling_2017} A convenient byproduct of the Kalman
  filter are maximum likelihood estimates for parameters which describe the time
  series in terms of an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process:~\cite{hamilton_time_1994}
  \begin{equation}
  Y_t = c + \phi_1 Y_{t-1} + \phi_2 Y_{t-2} + \cdot\cdot\cdot + \phi_p Y_{t-p} + \epsilon_t + \theta_1\epsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2\epsilon_{t-2} + \cdot\cdot\cdot + \theta_q\epsilon_{t-q}
  \label{eqn:arma}
  \end{equation}
  where $Y_t$ represents the time series value at time $t$, $\epsilon$ is a white noise
  parameter and $\phi$ and $\theta$ are coefficients determined by the Kalman filter. 
  With knowledge of the transition probabilities and the dynamic behavior of each
  state described by Equation~\ref{eqn:arma}, I can forecast solute time series orders of 
  magnitude longer than with molecular simulations.
  
  \noindent \textbf{\large Objective 4:} \textit{\large Apply analyses to 
  Q\textsubscript{I} phase} (\textcolor{blue}{\textbf{In Progress}})
  
  Paralleling my work on the H\textsubscript{II} phase, my first task towards
  this objective was to build a suitable unit cell representation of the 
  Q\textsubscript{I} phase. Unfortunately, the true space group of the 
  Q\textsubscript{I} phase that we are studying is unknown. Experimental 
  diffraction has narrowed down the possible bicontinuous cubic 
  configurations to the Ia3d and Pn3m space groups.~\cite{pindzola_cross-linked_2003}
  Therefore, we will build both types of unit cells and search for clues that
  can be used to differentiate them experimentally.

  \end{wrapfigure}
  
  I have developed a procedure that can build both Ia3d and Pn3m unit cells.
  To our knowledge, nobody has ever built an atomistic molecular model of 
  a bicontinuous cubic phase system. Some systems have been created by 
  allowing coarse grained representations to self-assemble over long 
  timescales.~\cite{mondal_self-assembly_2013} However, self-assembly
  can be a long process, especially for fully atomistic systems, where it
  might take multiple orders of magnitude longer than what we can 
  reasonably simulate. Instead, I use analytical equations that describe
  the surface of these systems in order to place monomers into a unit cell.~\cite{benedicto_bicontinuous_1997}
  Monomers are placed perpendicular to the surface in random locations 
  that don't overlap. One can control the pore size by translating monomers
  perpendicular to the surface at the point where they are attached.
  
  First, I will study the structure of the Q\textsubscript{I} phase using
  methodology similar to that used for the H\textsubscript{II} phase.
  I will attempt to identify one of the space groups as the most likely
  experimental configuration based on simulated XRD signatures, although
  this might not work due to the known similarity of Ia3d and Pn3m XRD 
  patterns for this system.
  
  Then I will study transport of solutes within these atomistic unit cells, 
  adapting the same analyses used in Objectives 2--3. The primary 
  challenge will be adapting my techniques to the more complex pore geometry
  of the Q\textsubscript{I} phase, however I expect that the main conclusions
  will not deviate far from those of the H\textsubscript{II} phase since
  the chemical environments within the nanopores are qualitatively similar. 
  
  The experimental performance of Q\textsubscript{I} phase membranes has been
  studied far more extensively than that of the H\textsubscript{II} phase. 
  Therefore, I may be able to identify which space group is correct if
  one system exhibits experimentally inconsistent transport properties and one
  does not. I can attempt to replicate the trends in the results of the separation
  studies performed by Dischinger et al.~\cite{dischinger_application_2017} If
  I can match the experimental trends, then there is a good chance that I can
  use my molecular model to offer an explanation for the complex behavior described
  in their work (see first paragraph of Section~\ref{section:objectives}).

  \section{Timeline for Completion of Objectives}\label{section:timeline}

  A schematic of the estimated timeline that I plan to follow for the 
  completion of tasks pertinent to finishing all objectives is given 
  in Table~\ref{table:timeline}. Ideally, each task will become a 
  published manuscript. I will run simulations required to 
  study the structure of the bicontinuous cubic phase in
  parallel with the continued development of my stochastic model of 
  transport in the H\textsubscript{II} phase. Simulations and analysis
  required for Q\textsubscript{I} phase solute transport studies analogous
  to those of Objective 2 will be carried out throughout Fall 2019. 
  Application of a stochastic model to the Q\textsubscript{I} phase will
  be finished by May 2020, just before I defend my dissertation.

  \section{Resource Requirements}\label{section:resources}
  
  The remainder of our work will require the use of high performance computing (HPC)
  resources. We will continue using Bridges, an XSEDE resource as well as Summit, a
  supercomputer located at CU Boulder.
  
  \section{Safety Considerations}\label{section:safety}
  
  Although my work is confined to computer work in an office space, there are 
  associated health risks that I must mitigate. Proper ergonomics ensure 
  maximum comfort and help me to work efficiently. Sitting up straight and
  having proper back support are necessary to relieve pressure on the discs
  of my vertebrae. My monitors are positioned an arm's length directly in 
  front of me with the tops of the monitors at eye level in order to reduce
  head, neck and eye strain. Finally, I take frequent breaks and go for 
  walks around the building.
