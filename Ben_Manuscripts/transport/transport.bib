	abstract = {The phase behaviour of the lyotropic liquid crystal sodium 3,4,5-tris(omega-acryloyloxyundecyloxy)-benzoate was investigated by small angle X-ray scattering. The water content of the lyotropic liquid crystal phase was varied between 8 and 20wt\% and the investigations were performed in a temperature range up to 70oC. A reversed hexagonal structure (H2-phase) as well as the isotropic phase were observed. The lattice constant of the H2-phase was found to be independent of the water content. An extremely small dependence on temperature could be found. Based on the shape of the molecules and the observed structural properties, a model for the arrangement of the molecules within the H2-phase is given. The transition temperature from the H2-phase to the isotropic phase decreases significantly from 60oC for the sample with 8wt\% water content to 30oC for the sample with 20wt\% water content.},

	abstract = {In pressure-driven membrane processes (reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration) a pressure exerted on the solution at one side of the membrane serves as a driving force to separate it into a permeate and a retentate. The permeate is usually pure water, whereas the retentate is a concentrated solution that must be disposed of or treated by other methods. Membranes may be polymeric, organo-mineral, ceramic, or metallic, and filtration techniques differ in pore size, from dense (no pores) to porous membranes. Depending on the type of technique, salts, small organic molecules, macromolecules, or particles can be retained, and the applied pressure will differ. This paper reviews the principles behind the different techniques, the types of membranes used, rejection mechanisms, and process modeling. Applications of pressure-driven membrane processes are also considered, including reverse osmosis and nanofiltration for the treatment of wastewater from landfills and composting plants, nanofiltration in the textile industry, and ultrafiltration and microfiltration in drinking water production and wastewater treatment. Lastly, the paper discusses recent developments, including techniques to prevent membrane fouling by modifications affecting surface roughness or hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, or by cleaning the membranes, and methods for treating or disposing of the retentate.},

	abstract = {We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Å, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Å, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Å and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes.},

	abstract = {Nanofiltration membranes (NF) have applications in several areas. One of the main applications has been in watertreatment for drinking water production as well as wastewater treatment. NF can either be used to treat all kinds of water including ground, surface, and wastewater or used as a pretreatment for desalination. The introduction of NF as a pretreatment is considered a breakthrough for the desalination process. NF membranes have been shown to be able to remove turbidity, microorganisms and hardness, as well as a fraction of the dissolved salts. This results in a significantly lower operating pressure and thus provides a much more energy-efficient process. Similar to other membrane processes, a major problem in NF membrane applications is fouling. Several studies have investigated the mechanisms of fouling in NF membranes and suggested methods to minimize and control the fouling of NF membranes. For NF membrane characterizations and process prediction, modeling of NF processes and the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) are very important. The ability to predict the performance of NF processes will lead to a lower number of experiments, saving of time and money, and help to understand the separation mechanisms during NF. A comprehensive review of NF in water treatments is presented including a review of the applications of NF in treating water as well as in the pretreatment process for desalination; the mechanism as well as minimization of NF membrane fouling problems; and theories for modelling and transport of salt, charged and noncharged organic compounds in NF membranes. The review will also address the application of AFM in studying the morphology of membrane surfaces as part of the NF membrane characterization.},

	abstract = {A thin-film composite, bicontinuous cubic lyotropic liquid crystal polymer (TFC QI) membrane with uniform-size, ionic nanopores was studied for the treatment of hydraulic fracturing flowback water. The TFC QI membrane performance was compared to those of a commercial nanofiltration (NF) membrane (NF270) and a commercial reverse osmosis (RO) membrane (SW30HR) for the filtration of flowback water from the Denver-Julesburg Basin. The permeability, salt rejection, and organic solute rejection for each membrane was evaluated. The results illustrate that the TFC QI membrane maintained its performance to a similar degree as the commercial NF and RO membranes while demonstrating a unique selectivity not observed in the commercial membranes. Specifically, the TFC QI membrane rejected 75\% of the salt while recovering 9.6\% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 50\% of the water. Of particular interest was the recovery of labile DOC, which was assessed through biodegradation experiments. Analysis following biodegradation of the TFC QI membrane permeate demonstrates the membrane's ability to recover labile DOC in a reduced-saline permeate. Improved recovery of labile DOC (increased to 22\%) was demonstrated by reducing the pH of the flowback water. Therefore, the selectivity of the TFC QI membrane provides an opportunity to recover resources from hydraulic fracturing flowback.},

Monovalent organosulfonate anions of various sizes were completely exchanged as the counterion at the pore walls to explore the impact of anion size on uncharged molecular solute rejection and water permeance. It was found that larger organosulfonate anions associated at the pore walls induced a higher rejection of uncharged solutes and a lower water permeance. The change in selectivity of the nanopores was described quantitatively through the calculation of the effective pore radius. The effective pore radius in these modified membranes was found to vary from 0.9±0.2 to 0.55±0.08nm depending on the resident organosulfonate counterion, demonstrating sub-1-nm resolution in pore size manipulation. An empirical model was used to demonstrate that physicochemical properties (molecular volume and hydrophobicity) of the resident counterion correlate with the observed solute rejection, suggesting that the counterion can be chosen to target a desired membrane performance. The ability to manipulate uniform, nm-sized pores with sub-1-nm resolution via simple anion-exchange offers a new avenue to tailor nanofiltration membrane performance.},

	abstract = {A polymeric membrane material for efficient water desalination based on a cross-linked type I bicontinuous cubic (QI) lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) assembly is described. This ordered, nanoporous, polymer material is formed by the self-assembly of a cross-linkable gemini amphiphile in water and contains interpenetrating organic networks separated from one another by a continuous, ultrathin water layer surface (ca. 0.75 nm gap spacing) with overall cubic symmetry. Supported membranes of this material are produced by hot-pressing the initial LLC monomer gel at high pressure through a commercial microporous hydrophilic membrane support at 70 °C and then radically photocross-linking the infused QI monomer phase. In stirred dead-end water filtration tests, the resulting 40-μm thick, optically transparent, supported LLC membranes exhibit 95−99.9\% rejection of dissolved salt ions, neutral molecules and macromolecules, and molecular ions in the 0.64−1.2 nm size range in a single pass. This rejection performance is slightly better than that of a commercial reverse osmosis (RO) membrane for the same solutes under the same test conditions, and significantly better than that of a commercial porous nanofiltration membrane. The LLC polymer material also exhibits a thickness- and pressure-normalized water permeability that is similar to or just slightly lower than the dense active layer materials used in current RO membranes. It is believed that the 3-D interconnected water manifold system in the cross-linked QI-phase material allows small water molecules (0.27 nm kinetic diameter) to pass through with good efficiency, while effectively rejecting dissolved solutes close in size to, or larger than, the about 0.75 nm water layer gap spacing.},

Our method provides confidence bands which take the variability of the initial configuration of the high-dimensional system, continuous nature of the work paths, and thermal fluctuations into account. Maximum-likelihood-type methods are used to estimate a stochastic differential equation (SDE) approximating the dynamics. For each observed time series, we estimate a new SDE resulting in a collection of SPA models. The physical significance of the collection of SPA models is discussed and methods for exploiting information in the population of estimated SPA models are demonstrated and suggested. Molecular dynamics simulations of potassium ion dynamics inside a gramicidin A channel are used to demonstrate the methodology, although SPA-type modeling has also proven useful in analyzing single-molecule experimental time series [J.

	abstract = {Single particle tracking (SPT) can aid in understanding a variety of complex spatiotemporal processes. However, quantifying diffusivity and confinement forces from individual live cell trajectories is complicated by inter- and intratrajectory kinetic heterogeneity, thermal fluctuations, and (experimentally resolvable) statistical temporal dependence inherent to the underlying molecule's time correlated confined dynamics experienced in the cell. The problem is further complicated by experimental artifacts such as localization uncertainty and motion blur. The latter is caused by the tagged molecule emitting photons at different spatial positions during the exposure time of a single frame. The aforementioned experimental artifacts induce spurious time correlations in measured SPT time series that obscure the information of interest (e.g., confinement forces and diffusivity). We develop a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) technique that decouples the above noise sources and systematically treats temporal correlation via time series methods. This ultimately permits a reliable algorithm for extracting diffusivity and effective forces in confined or unconfined environments. We illustrate how our approach avoids complications inherent to mean square displacement or autocorrelation techniques. Our algorithm modifies the established Kalman filter (which does not handle motion blur artifacts) to provide a likelihood based time series estimation procedure. The result extends A. J. Berglund's motion blur model [Phys. Rev. E 82, 011917 (2010)] to handle confined dynamics. The approach can also systematically utilize (possibly time dependent) localization uncertainty estimates afforded by image analysis if available. This technique, which explicitly treats confinement and motion blur within a time domain MLE framework, uses an exact likelihood (time domain methods facilitate analyzing nonstationary signals). Our estimator is demonstrated to be consistent over a wide range of exposure times (5 to 100 ms), diffusion coefficients (1×10−3 to 1μm2/s), and confinement widths (100 nm to 2μm). We demonstrate that neglecting motion blur or confinement can substantially bias estimation of kinetic parameters of interest to researchers. The technique also permits one to check statistical model assumptions against measured individual trajectories without “ground truth.” The ability to reliably and consistently extract motion parameters in trajectories exhibiting confined and/or non-stationary dynamics, without exposure time artifacts corrupting estimates, is expected to aid in directly comparing trajectories obtained from different experiments or imaging modalities. A Python implementation is provided (open-source code will be maintained on GitHub; see also the Supplemental Material with this paper).},

Long time series data and knowledge of the transition density associated with the assumed process model can be of great assistance in obtaining answers to the aforementioned questions. Unfortunately, a closed-form expression for the transition density is rarely available. Estimation and inference are carried out using approximated transition densities (the primary interest is in how Aït-Sahalia's transition density expansions perform in various multiscale contexts). A heuristic strategy for estimating a nonlinear diffusion which does not require one to assume the exact functional form of the diffusion coefficients is also presented.

	abstract = {Often gaining insight into the functioning of biomolecular systems requires to follow their dynamics along a microscopic reaction coordinate (RC) on a macroscopic time scale, which is beyond the reach of current all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A practical approach to this inherently multiscale problem is to model the system as a fictitious overdamped Brownian particle that diffuses along the RC in the presence of an effective potential of mean force (PMF) due to the rest of the system. By employing the recently proposed FR method [I. Kosztin et al., J. Chem. Phys. 124, 064106 (2006)], which requires only a small number of fast nonequilibrium MD simulations of the system in both forward and time reversed directions along the RC, we reconstruct the PMF: (1) of deca-alanine as a function of its end-to-end distance, and (2) that guides the motion of potassium ions through the gramicidin A channel. In both cases the computed PMFs are found to be in good agreement with previous results obtained by different methods. Our approach appears to be about one order of magnitude faster than the other PMF calculation methods and, in addition, it also provides the position-dependent diffusion coefficient along the RC. Thus, the obtained PMF and diffusion coefficient can be used in an overdamped Brownian model to estimate important characteristics of the studied systems, e.g., the mean folding time of the stretched deca-alanine and the mean diffusion time of the potassium ion through gramicidin A.},

Trajectories exhibited intermittent motion consistent with a generalized continuous time random walk (CTRW) model, where strongly confined “waiting times” alternated with rapid flights. The presence of three characteristic regimes emerged as a function of surface coverage, based on an analysis of effective short-time diffusion coefficients, mean-squared displacement, and CTRW distributions. The dilute “site-blocking” regime exhibited increasing short-time diffusion, less confined behavior, and shorter waiting times with higher surface coverage, as anomalously strong adsorption sites were increasingly passivated. At intermediate values of surface coverage, the “crowding” regime was distinguished by the exact opposite trends (slower, more confined mobility), presumably due to increasing intermolecular interactions. The trends reversed yet again in the “brush” regime, where adsorbing molecules interacted weakly with a layer of extended overlapping chains.},

	abstract = {In this work, methods to detect one or several change points in multivariate time series are reviewed. They include retrospective (off-line) procedure such as maximum likelihood estimation, regression, kernel methods, etc. In this large area of research, applications are numerous and diverse; many different models and operational constraints (on precision, complexity,...) exist. A formal framework for change point detection is introduced to give sens to this significant body of work. Precisely, all methods are described as a collection of three elements: a cost function, a search method and a constraint on the number of changes to detect. For a given method, we detail the assumed signal model, the associated algorithm, theoretical guarantees (if any) and the application domain. This approach is intended to facilitate prototyping of change point detection methods: for a given segmentation task, one can appropriately choose among the described elements to design an algorithm.},

Different physical scenarios leading to subdiffusion differ in the details of the dynamics. These differences are what allow to theoretically reconstruct the underlying physics from the results of observations, and will be the topic of this review. We review the main statistical analyses available today to distinguish between these scenarios, categorizing them according to the relevant characteristics. We collect the available tools and statistical tests, presenting them within a broader perspective. We also consider possible complications such as the subordination of subdiffusive mechanisms. Due to the advances in single particle tracking experiments in recent years, we focus on the relevant case of where the available experimental data is scant, at the level of single trajectories.},

	abstract = {Modern microscopic techniques following the stochastic motion of labelled tracer particles have uncovered significant deviations from the laws of Brownian motion in a variety of animate and inanimate systems. Such anomalous diffusion can have different physical origins, which can be identified from careful data analysis. In particular, single particle tracking provides the entire trajectory of the traced particle, which allows one to evaluate different observables to quantify the dynamics of the system under observation. We here provide an extensive overview over different popular anomalous diffusion models and their properties. We pay special attention to their ergodic properties, highlighting the fact that in several of these models the long time averaged mean squared displacement shows a distinct disparity to the regular, ensemble averaged mean squared displacement. In these cases, data obtained from time averages cannot be interpreted by the standard theoretical results for the ensemble averages. Here we therefore provide a comparison of the main properties of the time averaged mean squared displacement and its statistical behaviour in terms of the scatter of the amplitudes between the time averages obtained from different trajectories. We especially demonstrate how anomalous dynamics may be identified for systems, which, on first sight, appear to be Brownian. Moreover, we discuss the ergodicity breaking parameters for the different anomalous stochastic processes and showcase the physical origins for the various behaviours. This Perspective is intended as a guidebook for both experimentalists and theorists working on systems, which exhibit anomalous diffusion.},

This chapter describes the different models that are employed to describe anomalous diffusion, paying special attention to the experimental evidence that supports these models in the plasma membrane. We review models based on anticorrelated displacements, such as fractional Brownian motion and obstructed diffusion, and nonstationary models such as continuous time random walks. We also emphasize evidence for the formation of distinct compartments that transiently form on the cell surface. Finally, we overview heterogeneous diffusion processes in the plasma membrane, which have recently attracted considerable interest.},

This random force presents a fractional order derivative of white noise, and leads to a power-law time behavior of the mean square displacement of a particle, with the power exponent being noninteger. More general equation containing fractional time differential operators instead of usual ones is also proposed to describe anomalous diffusion processes. Such equation can be regarded as corresponding to systems with incomplete Hamiltonian chaos, and depending on the type of the relationship between the speed and coordinate of a particle yields either usual or fractional long-time behavior of diffusion. Correlations with the fractional Fokker-Planck equation are analyzed. Possible applications of the proposed equation beside anomalous diffusion itself are discussed.},

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution—the part of the distribution representing large but rare events—and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out.},

Since little is known about the removal of most of the substances included in the Decision 2015/495/EU, particularly regarding realistic concentrations in aqueous environmental samples, this review aims to: (i) overview the European policy in the water field; (ii) briefly describe the most commonly used conventional and advanced treatment processes to remove micropollutants; (iii) summarize the relevant data published in the last decade, regarding occurrence and removal in aqueous matrices of the 10 substances/groups of substances that were recently included in the first watch list for European Union monitoring (Decision 2015/495/EU); and (iv) highlight the lack of reports concerning some substances of the watch list, the study of un-spiked aquatic matrices and the assessment of transformation by-products.},

The particles’ mean squared displacement is found to depend on the way the mean is taken: temporal averaging over single-particle trajectories differs from averaging over an ensemble of particles. This is shown to stem from subordinating an ergodic anomalous process to a nonergodic one. The result is easily generalized to the subordination of any other ergodic process (i.e., fractional Brownian motion) to a nonergodic one. For certain parameters the ergodic diffusion on the underlying fractal structure dominates the transport yet displaying ergodicity breaking and aging.},

	abstract = {Periodic, nanostructured porous polymer membranes made from the cross-linked inverted hexagonal phase of self-assembled lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) are a promising class of materials for selective separations. In this work, we investigate an experimentally characterized LLC polymer membrane using atomistic molecular modeling. In particular, we compare simulated X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns with experimental XRD data to quantify and understand the differences between simulation and experiment. We find that the nanopores are likely composed of five columns of stacked LLC monomers which surround each hydrophilic core. Evidence suggests that these columns likely move independently of each other over longer time scales than accessible via atomistic simulation. We also find that wide-angle X-ray scattering structural features previously attributed to monomer tail tilt are likely instead due to ordered tail packing. Although this system has been reported as dry, we show that small amounts of water are necessary to reproduce all features from the experimental XRD pattern because of asymmetries introduced by hydrogen bonds between the monomer head groups and water molecules. Finally, we explore the composition and structure of the nanopores and reveal that there exists a composition gradient rather than an abrupt partition between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. A caveat is that the time scales of the dynamics are extremely long for this system, resulting in simulated structures that appear too ordered, thus requiring careful examination of the metastable states observed in order to draw any conclusions. The clear picture of the nanoscopic structure of these membranes provided in this study will enable a better understanding of the mechanisms of small-molecule transport within these nanopores.},

We report the synthesis and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) characterization of a series of perdeuterated gemini surfactant lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs), in which convex, water-filled nanopores of well-defined dimensions are lined with carboxylate functionalities. Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements of the translational water dynamics in these dicarboxylate LLC nanopores as functions of the surfactant hydration state and the charge compensating counterion (Na+, K+, NMe4+) reveal that the measured dynamics depend primarily on surfactant hydration, with an unexpected counterion dependence that varies with hydration number. We rationalize these trends in terms of a balance between counterion–water attractions and the nanopore volume excluded by the counterions. On the basis of electron density maps derived from SAXS analyses of these LLCs, we directly show that the volume excluded by the counterions depends on both their size and spatial distribution in the water-filled channels. The translational water dynamics in the convex pores of these LLCs are also slower than those reported in the concave pores of AOT reverse micelles, implying that water dynamics also depend on the nanopore curvature.},

By the space-time fractional diffusion equation we mean an evolution equation obtained from the standard linear diffusion equation by replacing the second-order space derivative with a Riesz-Feller derivative of order α ε (0, 2] and skewness θ ({\textbar}θ{\textbar} ≤ min \{α, 2 - α\}), and the first-order time derivative with a Caputo derivative of order β ε (0, 1]. The fundamental solution (for the Cauchy problem) of the fractional diffusion equation can be interpreted as a probability density evolving in time of a peculiar self-similar stochastic process. We view it as a generalized diffusion process that we call fractional diffusion process, and present an integral representation of the fundamental solution. A more general approach to anomalous diffusion is however known to be provided by the master equation for a continuous time random walk (CTRW). We show how this equation reduces to our fractional diffusion equation by a properly scaled passage to the limit of compressed waiting times and jump widths. Finally, we describe a method of simulation and display (via graphics) results of a few numerical case studies.},

Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we measured the anomalous diffusion exponent α characterizing the dependence of the mean-square displacement of the tracer proteins on time, 〈r2(t)〉∼tα. We observed that the diffusion of proteins in dextran solutions with concentrations up to 400g/l is subdiffusive (α{\textless}1) even at low obstacle concentration. The anomalous diffusion exponent α decreases continuously with increasing obstacle concentration and molecular weight, but does not depend on buffer ionic strength, and neither does it depend strongly on solution temperature. At very high random-coil polymer concentrations, α reaches a limit value of αl≈3/4, which we take to be the signature of a coupling between the motions of the tracer proteins and the segments of the dextran chains. A similar, although less pronounced, subdiffusive behavior is observed for the diffusion of streptavidin in concentrated globular protein solutions. These observations indicate that protein diffusion in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus should be anomalous as well, with consequences for measurements of solute diffusion coefficients in cells and for the modeling of cellular processes relying on diffusion.},

In particular, we study the degree of weak ergodicity breaking and scatter between different single trajectories for this confined motion in the subdiffusive domain. The general trend is that deviations from ergodicity are decreased with decreasing size of the movement volume and with increasing dimensionality. We define the displacement correlation function and find that this quantity shows distinct features for fractional Brownian motion, fractional Langevin equation, and continuous time subdiffusion, such that it appears an efficient measure to distinguish these different processes based on single-particle trajectory data.},

Often nitrogen- and oxygen-containing groups are exchanged, or both atoms occur in a competitive situation. We have investigated the hydrogen-bonding abilities of oxygen atoms covalently bound to two non-hydrogen atoms of which at least one is formally assigned to an sp2-type hybridization. In particular, examples in which such oxygen atoms compete with nitrogen atoms in the same molecular segment have been studied. Based on interaction energies obtained from ab initio calculations for complexes of these molecules with water, the oxygen atoms can be classified as rather weak hydrogen-bond acceptors; nitrogen atoms present in the same fragment exhibit much stronger interaction energies. The ab initio results are confirmed by the relative frequencies with which oxygen and nitrogen atoms are found to be involved in hydrogen bonding in the crystal structures of organic molecules containing the fragments of interest.},

In principle, the actual values of diffusion coefficient obtained carry important information about the sizes of different species and on interactions between species, but the relationship between diffusion coefficient and molecular mass is in general a very complex one.

The radii thus obtained are those of a hypothetical sphere whose hydrodynamic behavior is the same as that of the solute molecule plus that water of hydration which is too firmly bound to partake in the viscous shearing process. The results obtained compare favorably with radii determined from molecular models constructed in accordance with atomic dimensions compiled by Pauling. Although the application of the Einstein theory to molecules whose size is comparable to that of water represents a considerable extrapolation, the results suggest that this deviation from the assumptions of the theory, in the case of the molecules studied, is of second order importance.
Employing the viscometric radii, we have formulated an empirical correction of the Stokes-Einstein diffusion equation. This correction is similar in form to those previously proposed by Cunningham (22) and Millikan (21) and is of particular significance when the solute molecule is comparable in size to the discontinuities of the surrounding medium. The molecular radii of a number of small organic molecules obtained by means of the corrected Stokes-Einstein equation do not differ significantly from the radii obtained from molecular models of these compounds.},

However, extracting that information is not a trivial task due to the stochastic nature of particles' movement and the sampling noise. In this paper, we adopt a deep learning method known as a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify modes of diffusion from given trajectories. We compare this fully automated approach working with raw data to classical machine learning techniques that require data preprocessing and extraction of human-engineered features from the trajectories to feed classifiers like random forest or gradient boosting. All methods are tested using simulated trajectories for which the underlying physical model is known. From the results, it follows that although the feature-based methods perform better than CNN in terms of accuracy and are computationally cheaper, the performance of CNN is already very good and may be probably improved after carrying out an expanded search for the best performing CNN model on an HPC platform.},

Over the past decade, it has been found that the ion conductivity in nanopores could be drastically enhanced, and different mechanisms have been proposed to explain this observation. To date, most reported studies have been carried out with relatively dilute electrolytes, while ion transport in nanopores under high electrolyte concentrations ({\textgreater}1 M) has been rarely explored. Through systematic experimental and atomistic simulation studies with NaCl solutions, here we show that at high electrolyte concentrations, ion mobility in small nanopores could be significantly reduced from the corresponding bulk value. Subsequent molecular dynamics studies indicate that in addition to the low mobility of surface-bound ions in the Stern layer, enhanced pairing and collisions between partially dehydrated ions of opposite charges also make important contributions to the reduced ion mobility. Furthermore, we show that the extent of mobility reduction depends on the association constant between cations and anions in different electrolytes with a more drastic reduction for a larger association constant.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the hydration structure of Na+ and K+ in the liquid phase has wide ranging implications in the field of biological chemistry. Despite numerous experimental and computational studies, even basic features such as the coordination number of these alkali ions in liquid water, thought to play a critical role in selectivity, continue to be the subject of intensive debates. Simulations based on accurate potential energy surfaces offer one approach to resolve these issues by providing reliable results on ion hydration. In this article, we report the results from molecular dynamics simulations of Na+ and K+ hydration based on a novel and rigorous strategy designed to overcome the challenges of QM/MM simulations of solvent molecules in the liquid phase. In this method, which we call Flexible Inner Region Ensemble Separator (FIRES), the ion and a fixed number of nearest water molecules form a dynamical and flexible inner region that is represented with high level ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) methods, while the water molecules from the surrounding bulk form an outer region that is represented by a polarizable molecular mechanical (MM) force field. Simulations yield rigorously correct thermodynamic averages as long as the solvent molecules in the flexible inner and outer regions are not allowed to exchange. Extensive FIRES simulations were carried out based on a QM/MM model in which the Na+ or K+ ion and the 12 nearest water molecules were represented by high level ab initio methods (RI-MP2/def2-TZVP and density functional theory with PBE/def2-TZVP), while the surrounding MM water molecules were represented by the polarizable SWM4-NDP potential. On the basis of these results, the ion coordination numbers are estimated to be within the range of 5.7–5.8 for Na+ and 6.9–7.0 for K+.},

	abstract = {A ubiquitous observation in cell biology is that the diffusive motion of macromolecules and organelles is anomalous, and a description simply based on the conventional diffusion equation with diffusion constants measured in dilute solution fails. This is commonly attributed to macromolecular crowding in the interior of cells and in cellular membranes, summarizing their densely packed and heterogeneous structures. The most familiar phenomenon is a sublinear, power-law increase of the mean-square displacement (MSD) as a function of the lag time, but there are other manifestations like strongly reduced and time-dependent diffusion coefficients, persistent correlations in time, non-Gaussian distributions of spatial displacements, heterogeneous diffusion and a fraction of immobile particles. After a general introduction to the statistical description of slow, anomalous transport, we summarize some widely used theoretical models: Gaussian models like fractional Brownian motion and Langevin equations for visco-elastic media, the continuous-time random walk model, and the Lorentz model describing obstructed transport in a heterogeneous environment. Particular emphasis is put on the spatio-temporal properties of the transport in terms of two-point correlation functions, dynamic scaling behaviour, and how the models are distinguished by their propagators even if the MSDs are identical. Then, we review the theory underlying commonly applied experimental techniques in the presence of anomalous transport like single-particle tracking, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We report on the large body of recent experimental evidence for anomalous transport in crowded biological media: in cyto- and nucleoplasm as well as in cellular membranes, complemented by in vitro experiments where a variety of model systems mimic physiological crowding conditions. Finally, computer simulations are discussed which play an important role in testing the theoretical models and corroborating the experimental findings. The review is completed by a synthesis of the theoretical and experimental progress identifying open questions for future investigation.},

	abstract = {Random walk is a fundamental concept with applications ranging from quantum physics to econometrics. Remarkably, one specific model of random walks appears to be ubiquitous across many fields as a tool to analyze transport phenomena in which the dispersal process is faster than dictated by Brownian diffusion. The Lévy-walk model combines two key features, the ability to generate anomalously fast diffusion and a finite velocity of a random walker. Recent results in optics, Hamiltonian chaos, cold atom dynamics, biophysics, and behavioral science demonstrate that this particular type of random walk provides significant insight into complex transport phenomena. This review gives a self-consistent introduction to Lévy walks, surveys their existing applications, including latest advances, and outlines further perspectives.},

	abstract = {In order to study transport in complex environments, it is extremely important to determine the physical mechanism underlying diffusion, and precisely characterize its nature and parameters. Often, this task is strongly impacted by data consisting of trajectories with short length and limited localization precision. In this paper, we propose a machine learning method based on a random forest architecture, which is able to associate even very short trajectories to the underlying diffusion mechanism with a high accuracy. In addition, the method is able to classify the motion according to normal or anomalous diffusion, and determine its anomalous exponent with a small error. The method provides highly accurate outputs even when working with very short trajectories and in the presence of experimental noise. We further demonstrate the application of transfer learning to experimental and simulated data not included in the training/testing dataset. This allows for a full, high-accuracy characterization of experimental trajectories without the need of any prior information.},

However, extracting that information is not a trivial task due to the stochastic nature of particles’ movement and the sampling noise. In this paper, we adopt a deep learning method known as a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify modes of diﬀusion from given trajectories. We compare this fully automated approach working with raw data to classical machine learning techniques that require data preprocessing and extraction of human-engineered features from the trajectories to feed classiﬁers like random forest or gradient boosting. All methods are tested using simulated trajectories for which the underlying physical model is known. From the results it follows that although the feature-based methods perform better than CNN in terms of accuracy and are computationally cheaper, the performance of CNN is already very good and may be probably improved after carrying out an expanded search for the best performing CNN model on an HPC platform.},

Molecular dynamics simulations of 9, 18, 27, and 36-mers of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and 27-mers of polyethylene glycol (PEG) in water based on C35r yield a persistence length λ=3.7Å, in quantitative agreement with experimentally obtained values of 3.7Å for PEO and 3.8Å for PEG; agreement with experimental values for hydrodynamic radii of comparably sized PEG is also excellent. The exponent υ relating the radius of gyration and molecular weight (Rg∝Mwυ) of PEO from the simulations equals 0.515±0.023, consistent with experimental observations that low molecular weight PEG behaves as an ideal chain. The shape anisotropy of hydrated PEO is 2.59:1.44:1.00. The dimension of the middle length for each of the polymers nearly equals the hydrodynamic radius Rh obtained from diffusion measurements in solution. This explains the correspondence of Rh and Rp, the pore radius of membrane channels: a polymer such as PEG diffuses with its long axis parallel to the membrane channel, and passes through the channel without substantial distortion.},

Using molecular-dynamics simulations, we study the critical size and find that the van der Waals force plays an important role in particle diffusion as the particle size approaches molecular scale. Due to the limitations of computing facilities, we could not find exactly where the critical particle size is, but the simulation results qualitatively predict that this critical size is of a few nanometers.},

The experiment and calculation results reveal that the Na-O inorganic layer provides both Na+ ion transport pathway and storage site, whereas the benzene organic layer provides electron transport pathway and redox center. Our contribution provides a brand-new insight in understanding the storage mechanism in inorganic-organic layered host and opens up a new exciting direction for designing new materials for secondary batteries.

Such gradients are used in many essential processes, notably for generating action potentials. Na+, K+-ATPase is a member of the P-type ATPases, which include sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase and gastric H+, K+-ATPase, among others, and is the target of cardiac glycosides. Here we describe a crystal structure of this important ion pump, from shark rectal glands, consisting of α- and β-subunits and a regulatory FXYD protein3,4, all of which are highly homologous to human ones. The ATPase was fixed in a state analogous to E2·2K+·Pi, in which the ATPase has a high affinity for K+ and still binds Pi, as in the first crystal structure of pig kidney enzyme at 3.5 Å resolution5. Clearly visualized now at 2.4 Å resolution are coordination of K+ and associated water molecules in the transmembrane binding sites and a phosphate analogue (MgF42-) in the phosphorylation site. The crystal structure shows that the β-subunit has a critical role in K+ binding (although its involvement has previously been suggested6,7,8) and explains, at least partially, why the homologous Ca2+-ATPase counter-transports H+ rather than K+, despite the coordinating residues being almost identical.},

One of the reasons being considered for this is the smaller electronegativity of S than O or N. However, recent high resolution laser spectroscopy in combination with quantum chemical calculations reveals that SCHBs can be as strong as conventional H-bonds. Surprisingly, in the case of methionine containing dipeptides the amide-N–H· · · S H-bonds are even stronger than amide-N–H· · · O = C H-bonds. Sulfur is not only a potential H-bond acceptor, but the S–H group is also a very good H-bond donor and capable of forming a variety of H-bonds. For example, the S–H· · · π H-bond between H2S and indole/benzene is found to be the strongest H-bond among O–H· · · π, O–H· · · π, and C–H· · · π H-bonds. In general the SCHBs are dispersive in nature. This chapter details about few SCHB systems, many more systems need to be studied extensively and carefully to unravel many facts and facets about SCHBs. The major challenge for the experimentalists is to accurately determine the intra- and intermolecular H-bond energies and for the theoreticians to propose a universal H-bond descriptor.},

	abstract = {Throughout the world, water scarcity is being recognised as a present or future threat to human activity and as a consequence, a definite trend to develop alternative water resources such as desalination can be observed. The most commonly used desalination technologies are reverse osmosis (RO) and thermal processes such as multi-stage flash (MSF) and multi-effect distillation (MED). In Europe, reverse osmosis, due to its lower energy consumption has gained much wider acceptance than its thermal alternatives. This review summarises the current state-of-the art of reverse osmosis desalination, dealing not only with the reverse osmosis stage, but with the entire process from raw water intake to post treatment of product water. The discussion of process fundamentals, membranes and membrane modules and of current and future developments in membrane technology is accompanied by an analysis of operational issues as fouling and scaling and of measures for their prevention such as adequate cleaning procedures and antiscalant use. Special focus is placed on pre-treatment of raw water and post-treatment of brine as well as of product water to meet drinking and irrigation water standards, including evaluation of current boron removal options. Energy requirements of reverse osmosis plants as well as currently applied energy recovery systems for reduction of energy consumption are described and cost and cost structure of reverse osmosis desalination are outlined. Finally, current practices of waste management and disposal as well as new trends such as the use of hybrid plants, i.e. combining reverse osmosis with thermal processes and/or power generation are addressed.},

	abstract = {Conventional water resources in many regions are insufficient to meet the water needs of growing populations, thus reuse is gaining acceptance as a method of water supply augmentation. Recent advancements in membrane technology have allowed for the reclamation of municipal wastewater for the production of drinking water, i.e., potable reuse. Although public perception can be a challenge, potable reuse is often the least energy-intensive method of providing additional drinking water to water stressed regions. A variety of membranes have been developed that can remove water contaminants ranging from particles and pathogens to dissolved organic compounds and salts. Typically, potable reuse treatment plants use polymeric membranes for microfiltration or ultrafiltration in conjunction with reverse osmosis and, in some cases, nanofiltration. Membrane properties, including pore size, wettability, surface charge, roughness, thermal resistance, chemical stability, permeability, thickness and mechanical strength, vary between membranes and applications. Advancements in membrane technology including new membrane materials, coatings, and manufacturing methods, as well as emerging membrane processes such as membrane bioreactors, electrodialysis, and forward osmosis have been developed to improve selectivity, energy consumption, fouling resistance, and/or capital cost. The purpose of this review is to provide a comprehensive summary of the role of polymeric membranes and process components in the treatment of wastewater to potable water quality and to highlight recent advancements and needs in separation processes. Beyond membranes themselves, this review covers the background and history of potable reuse, and commonly used potable reuse process chains, pretreatment steps, and advanced oxidation processes. Key trends in membrane technology include novel configurations, materials, and fouling prevention techniques. Challenges still facing membrane-based potable reuse applications, including chemical and biological contaminant removal, membrane fouling, and public perception, are highlighted as areas in need of further research and development.},

The procedures for calculating these functions by the molecular dynamics method are described and the results for water models of 3456 molecules at 310 K are reported. The peak of short-lived spurious H-bonds, which results from short-time violations of hydrogen bonding criteria induced by dynamic intermolecular vibrations of molecules, prevails in the types of distributions most often referred to in the literature. A special distribution that appears to have not been used before is proposed. Along with short-lived bonds, it manifests long-lived ones whose lifetime is determined by the genuine, or random, hydrogen bond breaking rather than by dynamic. A technique to exclude dynamic effects and reveal the genuine H-bond breaking is proposed. This allows the evaluation of the average lifetime of “true” H-bonds that turns out to exceed 3 ps.},

	abstract = {We study the temperature dependence of the lifetime of geometric and geometric/energetic water hydrogen-bonds (H-bonds), down to supercooled water, through molecular dynamics. The probability and lifetime of H-bonds that break either by translational or librational motions and those of energetic broken H-bonds, along with the effects of transient broken H-bonds and transient H-bonds, are considered. We show that the fraction of transiently broken energetic H-bonds increases at low temperatures and that this energetic breakdown is caused by oxygen–oxygen electrostatic repulsions upon too small amplitude librations to disrupt geometric H-bonds. Hence, differences between geometric and energetic continuous H-bond lifetimes are associated with large H-bond energy fluctuations, in opposition to moderate geometric fluctuations, within common energetic and geometric H-bond definition thresholds. Exclusion of transient broken H-bonds and transient H-bonds leads to H-bond definition-independent mean lifetimes and activation energies, ∼11 kJ/mol, consistent with the reactive flux method and experimental scattering results. Further, we show that power law decay of specific temporal H-bond lifetime probability distributions is associated with librational and translational motions that occur on the time scale (∼0.1 ps) of H-bond breaking /re-forming dynamics. While our analysis is diffusion-free, the effect of diffusion on H-bond probability distributions where H-bonds are allowed to break and re-form, switching acceptors in between, is shown to result in neither exponential nor power law decay, similar to the reactive flux correlation function.},

Here, the development of self-organized nanostructured water treatment membranes based on ionic liquid crystals composed of ammonium, imidazolium, and pyridinium moieties is reported. Membranes with preserved 1D or 3D self-organized sub-nanopores are obtained by photopolymerization of ionic columnar or bicontinuous cubic liquid crystals. These membranes show salt rejection ability, ion selectivity, and excellent water permeability. The relationships between the structures and the transport properties of water molecules and ionic solutes in the sub-nanopores in the membranes are examined by molecular dynamics simulations. The results suggest that the volume of vacant space in the nanochannel greatly affects the water and ion permeability.},

It is found that the effects are dependent on the size of the solute pairs studied. Evidence of the dependence of the solute-shape effects on solvent properties is also demonstrated and discussed. Here, some new diffusion data of aromatic compounds in methanol at different temperatures are reported. The result for methanol in this study indicates that the effects of solute shape on diffusivity are only weakly dependent on temperature.},

To this end, leading researchers in the field of amphiphilic block copolymer self-assembly, some having a background in surfactant chemistry, and others with polymer physics roots, have agreed to join forces and contribute to this book. The book consists of four entities. The first part discusses theoretical considerations behind the block copolymer self-assembly in solution and in the melt. The second part provides case studies of self-assembly in different classes of block copolymers (e.g., polyethers, polyelectrolytes) and in different environments (e.g., in water, in non-aqueous solvents, or in the absence of solvents). The third part presents experimental tools, ranging from static (e.g., small angle neutron scattering) to dynamic (e.g., rheology), which can prove valuable in the characterization of block copolymer self-assemblies. The fourth part offers a sampling of current applications of block copolymers in, e.g., formulations, pharmaceutics, and separations, applications which are based on the unique self-assembly properties of block copolymers.},
