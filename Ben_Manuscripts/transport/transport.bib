	abstract = {The phase behaviour of the lyotropic liquid crystal sodium 3,4,5-tris(omega-acryloyloxyundecyloxy)-benzoate was investigated by small angle X-ray scattering. The water content of the lyotropic liquid crystal phase was varied between 8 and 20wt\% and the investigations were performed in a temperature range up to 70oC. A reversed hexagonal structure (H2-phase) as well as the isotropic phase were observed. The lattice constant of the H2-phase was found to be independent of the water content. An extremely small dependence on temperature could be found. Based on the shape of the molecules and the observed structural properties, a model for the arrangement of the molecules within the H2-phase is given. The transition temperature from the H2-phase to the isotropic phase decreases significantly from 60oC for the sample with 8wt\% water content to 30oC for the sample with 20wt\% water content.},

	abstract = {We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Å, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Å, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Å and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes.},

	abstract = {A polymeric membrane material for efficient water desalination based on a cross-linked type I bicontinuous cubic (QI) lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) assembly is described. This ordered, nanoporous, polymer material is formed by the self-assembly of a cross-linkable gemini amphiphile in water and contains interpenetrating organic networks separated from one another by a continuous, ultrathin water layer surface (ca. 0.75 nm gap spacing) with overall cubic symmetry. Supported membranes of this material are produced by hot-pressing the initial LLC monomer gel at high pressure through a commercial microporous hydrophilic membrane support at 70 °C and then radically photocross-linking the infused QI monomer phase. In stirred dead-end water filtration tests, the resulting 40-μm thick, optically transparent, supported LLC membranes exhibit 95−99.9\% rejection of dissolved salt ions, neutral molecules and macromolecules, and molecular ions in the 0.64−1.2 nm size range in a single pass. This rejection performance is slightly better than that of a commercial reverse osmosis (RO) membrane for the same solutes under the same test conditions, and significantly better than that of a commercial porous nanofiltration membrane. The LLC polymer material also exhibits a thickness- and pressure-normalized water permeability that is similar to or just slightly lower than the dense active layer materials used in current RO membranes. It is believed that the 3-D interconnected water manifold system in the cross-linked QI-phase material allows small water molecules (0.27 nm kinetic diameter) to pass through with good efficiency, while effectively rejecting dissolved solutes close in size to, or larger than, the about 0.75 nm water layer gap spacing.},

For each observed time series, we estimate a new SDE resulting in a collection of SPA models. The physical significance of the collection of SPA models is discussed and methods for exploiting information in the population of estimated SPA models are demonstrated and suggested. Molecular dynamics simulations of potassium ion dynamics inside a gramicidin A channel are used to demonstrate the methodology, although SPA-type modeling has also proven useful in analyzing single-molecule experimental time series [J.

	abstract = {Single particle tracking (SPT) can aid in understanding a variety of complex spatiotemporal processes. However, quantifying diffusivity and confinement forces from individual live cell trajectories is complicated by inter- and intratrajectory kinetic heterogeneity, thermal fluctuations, and (experimentally resolvable) statistical temporal dependence inherent to the underlying molecule's time correlated confined dynamics experienced in the cell. The problem is further complicated by experimental artifacts such as localization uncertainty and motion blur. The latter is caused by the tagged molecule emitting photons at different spatial positions during the exposure time of a single frame. The aforementioned experimental artifacts induce spurious time correlations in measured SPT time series that obscure the information of interest (e.g., confinement forces and diffusivity). We develop a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) technique that decouples the above noise sources and systematically treats temporal correlation via time series methods. This ultimately permits a reliable algorithm for extracting diffusivity and effective forces in confined or unconfined environments. We illustrate how our approach avoids complications inherent to mean square displacement or autocorrelation techniques. Our algorithm modifies the established Kalman filter (which does not handle motion blur artifacts) to provide a likelihood based time series estimation procedure. The result extends A. J. Berglund's motion blur model [Phys. Rev. E 82, 011917 (2010)] to handle confined dynamics. The approach can also systematically utilize (possibly time dependent) localization uncertainty estimates afforded by image analysis if available. This technique, which explicitly treats confinement and motion blur within a time domain MLE framework, uses an exact likelihood (time domain methods facilitate analyzing nonstationary signals). Our estimator is demonstrated to be consistent over a wide range of exposure times (5 to 100 ms), diffusion coefficients (1×10−3 to 1μm2/s), and confinement widths (100 nm to 2μm). We demonstrate that neglecting motion blur or confinement can substantially bias estimation of kinetic parameters of interest to researchers. The technique also permits one to check statistical model assumptions against measured individual trajectories without “ground truth.” The ability to reliably and consistently extract motion parameters in trajectories exhibiting confined and/or non-stationary dynamics, without exposure time artifacts corrupting estimates, is expected to aid in directly comparing trajectories obtained from different experiments or imaging modalities. A Python implementation is provided (open-source code will be maintained on GitHub; see also the Supplemental Material with this paper).},

Long time series data and knowledge of the transition density associated with the assumed process model can be of great assistance in obtaining answers to the aforementioned questions. Unfortunately, a closed-form expression for the transition density is rarely available. Estimation and inference are carried out using approximated transition densities (the primary interest is in how Aït-Sahalia's transition density expansions perform in various multiscale contexts). A heuristic strategy for estimating a nonlinear diffusion which does not require one to assume the exact functional form of the diffusion coefficients is also presented.

	abstract = {Often gaining insight into the functioning of biomolecular systems requires to follow their dynamics along a microscopic reaction coordinate (RC) on a macroscopic time scale, which is beyond the reach of current all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A practical approach to this inherently multiscale problem is to model the system as a fictitious overdamped Brownian particle that diffuses along the RC in the presence of an effective potential of mean force (PMF) due to the rest of the system. By employing the recently proposed FR method [I. Kosztin et al., J. Chem. Phys. 124, 064106 (2006)], which requires only a small number of fast nonequilibrium MD simulations of the system in both forward and time reversed directions along the RC, we reconstruct the PMF: (1) of deca-alanine as a function of its end-to-end distance, and (2) that guides the motion of potassium ions through the gramicidin A channel. In both cases the computed PMFs are found to be in good agreement with previous results obtained by different methods. Our approach appears to be about one order of magnitude faster than the other PMF calculation methods and, in addition, it also provides the position-dependent diffusion coefficient along the RC. Thus, the obtained PMF and diffusion coefficient can be used in an overdamped Brownian model to estimate important characteristics of the studied systems, e.g., the mean folding time of the stretched deca-alanine and the mean diffusion time of the potassium ion through gramicidin A.},

New experimental methods for increased resolution are needed to determine distinct solvent environments and transport properties. Using HRMAS NMR, resonances from water and methanol in both a free (bulk-like) environment and membrane-associated environment within the AEM were observed. 1H HRMAS PFG NMR experiments identified different molecular diffusion environments in the solvent, while 1H 2D NOESY exchange NMR experiments confirmed spatial contacts between membrane-associated species and the membrane. These results demonstrate that 1H HRMAS is an ideal technique for the characterization of individual environments and diffusion rates in polymer membranes with mixed solvent systems.},

Trajectories exhibited intermittent motion consistent with a generalized continuous time random walk (CTRW) model, where strongly confined “waiting times” alternated with rapid flights. The presence of three characteristic regimes emerged as a function of surface coverage, based on an analysis of effective short-time diffusion coefficients, mean-squared displacement, and CTRW distributions. The dilute “site-blocking” regime exhibited increasing short-time diffusion, less confined behavior, and shorter waiting times with higher surface coverage, as anomalously strong adsorption sites were increasingly passivated. At intermediate values of surface coverage, the “crowding” regime was distinguished by the exact opposite trends (slower, more confined mobility), presumably due to increasing intermolecular interactions. The trends reversed yet again in the “brush” regime, where adsorbing molecules interacted weakly with a layer of extended overlapping chains.},

A formal framework for change point detection is introduced to give sens to this significant body of work. Precisely, all methods are described as a collection of three elements: a cost function, a search method and a constraint on the number of changes to detect. For a given method, we detail the assumed signal model, the associated algorithm, theoretical guarantees (if any) and the application domain.

We collect the available tools and statistical tests, presenting them within a broader perspective. We also consider possible complications such as the subordination of subdiffusive mechanisms.

	abstract = {Modern microscopic techniques following the stochastic motion of labelled tracer particles have uncovered significant deviations from the laws of Brownian motion in a variety of animate and inanimate systems. Such anomalous diffusion can have different physical origins, which can be identified from careful data analysis. In particular, single particle tracking provides the entire trajectory of the traced particle, which allows one to evaluate different observables to quantify the dynamics of the system under observation. We here provide an extensive overview over different popular anomalous diffusion models and their properties. We pay special attention to their ergodic properties, highlighting the fact that in several of these models the long time averaged mean squared displacement shows a distinct disparity to the regular, ensemble averaged mean squared displacement. In these cases, data obtained from time averages cannot be interpreted by the standard theoretical results for the ensemble averages. Here we therefore provide a comparison of the main properties of the time averaged mean squared displacement and its statistical behaviour in terms of the scatter of the amplitudes between the time averages obtained from different trajectories. We especially demonstrate how anomalous dynamics may be identified for systems, which, on first sight, appear to be Brownian. Moreover, we discuss the ergodicity breaking parameters for the different anomalous stochastic processes and showcase the physical origins for the various behaviours. This Perspective is intended as a guidebook for both experimentalists and theorists working on systems, which exhibit anomalous diffusion.},

We review models based on anticorrelated displacements, such as fractional Brownian motion and obstructed diffusion, and nonstationary models such as continuous time random walks.

Such equation can be regarded as corresponding to systems with incomplete Hamiltonian chaos, and depending on the type of the relationship between the speed and coordinate of a particle yields either usual or fractional long-time behavior of diffusion. Correlations with the fractional Fokker-Planck equation are analyzed. Possible applications of the proposed equation beside anomalous diffusion itself are discussed.},

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution—the part of the distribution representing large but rare events—and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out.},

These fractional equations are derived asymptotically from basic random walk models, and from a generalised master equation. Several physical consequences are discussed which are relevant to dynamical processes in complex systems. Methods of solution are introduced and for some special cases exact solutions are calculated.

This is shown to stem from subordinating an ergodic anomalous process to a nonergodic one.

In this work, we investigate an experimentally characterized LLC polymer membrane using atomistic molecular modeling. In particular, we compare simulated X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns with experimental XRD data to quantify and understand the differences between simulation and experiment. We find that the nanopores are likely composed of five columns of stacked LLC monomers which surround each hydrophilic core. Evidence suggests that these columns likely move independently of each other over longer time scales than accessible via atomistic simulation. We also find that wide-angle X-ray scattering structural features previously attributed to monomer tail tilt are likely instead due to ordered tail packing. Although this system has been reported as dry, we show that small amounts of water are necessary to reproduce all features from the experimental XRD pattern because of asymmetries introduced by hydrogen bonds between the monomer head groups and water molecules. Finally, we explore the composition and structure of the nanopores and reveal that there exists a composition gradient rather than an abrupt partition between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. A caveat is that the time scales of the dynamics are extremely long for this system, resulting in simulated structures that appear too ordered, thus requiring careful examination of the metastable states observed in order to draw any conclusions. The clear picture of the nanoscopic structure of these membranes provided in this study will enable a better understanding of the mechanisms of small-molecule transport within these nanopores.},

We report the synthesis and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) characterization of a series of perdeuterated gemini surfactant lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs), in which convex, water-filled nanopores of well-defined dimensions are lined with carboxylate functionalities. Quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements of the translational water dynamics in these dicarboxylate LLC nanopores as functions of the surfactant hydration state and the charge compensating counterion (Na+, K+, NMe4+) reveal that the measured dynamics depend primarily on surfactant hydration, with an unexpected counterion dependence that varies with hydration number. We rationalize these trends in terms of a balance between counterion–water attractions and the nanopore volume excluded by the counterions. On the basis of electron density maps derived from SAXS analyses of these LLCs, we directly show that the volume excluded by the counterions depends on both their size and spatial distribution in the water-filled channels. The translational water dynamics in the convex pores of these LLCs are also slower than those reported in the concave pores of AOT reverse micelles, implying that water dynamics also depend on the nanopore curvature.},

By the space-time fractional diffusion equation we mean an evolution equation obtained from the standard linear diffusion equation by replacing the second-order space derivative with a Riesz-Feller derivative of order α ε (0, 2] and skewness θ ({\textbar}θ{\textbar} ≤ min \{α, 2 - α\}), and the first-order time derivative with a Caputo derivative of order β ε (0, 1]. The fundamental solution (for the Cauchy problem) of the fractional diffusion equation can be interpreted as a probability density evolving in time of a peculiar self-similar stochastic process. We view it as a generalized diffusion process that we call fractional diffusion process, and present an integral representation of the fundamental solution. A more general approach to anomalous diffusion is however known to be provided by the master equation for a continuous time random walk (CTRW). We show how this equation reduces to our fractional diffusion equation by a properly scaled passage to the limit of compressed waiting times and jump widths. Finally, we describe a method of simulation and display (via graphics) results of a few numerical case studies.},

	abstract = {We have studied the diffusion of tracer proteins in highly concentrated random-coil polymer and globular protein solutions imitating the crowded conditions encountered in cellular environments. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we measured the anomalous diffusion exponent α characterizing the dependence of the mean-square displacement of the tracer proteins on time, 〈r2(t)〉∼tα. We observed that the diffusion of proteins in dextran solutions with concentrations up to 400g/l is subdiffusive (α{\textless}1) even at low obstacle concentration. The anomalous diffusion exponent α decreases continuously with increasing obstacle concentration and molecular weight, but does not depend on buffer ionic strength, and neither does it depend strongly on solution temperature. At very high random-coil polymer concentrations, α reaches a limit value of αl≈3/4, which we take to be the signature of a coupling between the motions of the tracer proteins and the segments of the dextran chains. A similar, although less pronounced, subdiffusive behavior is observed for the diffusion of streptavidin in concentrated globular protein solutions. These observations indicate that protein diffusion in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus should be anomalous as well, with consequences for measurements of solute diffusion coefficients in cells and for the modeling of cellular processes relying on diffusion.},

We investigate by analytic calculations and simulations how time-averaged observables (e.g., the time-averaged mean-squared displacement and displacement correlation) are affected by spatial confinement and dimensionality. In particular, we study the degree of weak ergodicity breaking and scatter between different single trajectories for this confined motion in the subdiffusive domain. The general trend is that deviations from ergodicity are decreased with decreasing size of the movement volume and with increasing dimensionality. We define the displacement correlation function and find that this quantity shows distinct features for fractional Brownian motion, fractional Langevin equation, and continuous time subdiffusion, such that it appears an efficient measure to distinguish these different processes based on single-particle trajectory data.},

We have investigated the hydrogen-bonding abilities of oxygen atoms covalently bound to two non-hydrogen atoms of which at least one is formally assigned to an sp2-type hybridization. In particular, examples in which such oxygen atoms compete with nitrogen atoms in the same molecular segment have been studied. Based on interaction energies obtained from ab initio calculations for complexes of these molecules with water, the oxygen atoms can be classified as rather weak hydrogen-bond acceptors; nitrogen atoms present in the same fragment exhibit much stronger interaction energies. The ab initio results are confirmed by the relative frequencies with which oxygen and nitrogen atoms are found to be involved in hydrogen bonding in the crystal structures of organic molecules containing the fragments of interest.},

We present a novel method extending the range of validity of the Stokes–Einstein relationship by means of introducing a molecule-specific microfriction correction factor. This factor equals to 1 in the ordinary form of the Stokes–Einstein formula for ‘stick’ boundary conditions when molecules of solvent are much smaller than the diffusing particle. We have determined the microfriction correction factors for series of small molecules (ranging in size from ethanol to 18-crown-6 ether and tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)silane) in a dilute hexane solution by a concerted use of the NMR diffusion measurements and the molecular hydrodynamic calculations.

In principle, the actual values of diffusion coefficient obtained carry important information about the sizes of different species and on interactions between species, but the relationship between diffusion coefficient and molecular mass is in general a very complex one. Here a recently proposed analytical relationship between diffusion coefficient and molecular mass for the restricted case of small organic molecules is tested against a wide range of data from the scientific literature and generalized to cover a range of solvents and temperatures.},

The radii thus obtained are those of a hypothetical sphere whose hydrodynamic behavior is the same as that of the solute molecule plus that water of hydration which is too firmly bound to partake in the viscous shearing process. The results obtained compare favorably with radii determined from molecular models constructed in accordance with atomic dimensions compiled by Pauling. Although the application of the Einstein theory to molecules whose size is comparable to that of water represents a considerable extrapolation, the results suggest that this deviation from the assumptions of the theory, in the case of the molecules studied, is of second order importance.
Employing the viscometric radii, we have formulated an empirical correction of the Stokes-Einstein diffusion equation. This correction is similar in form to those previously proposed by Cunningham (22) and Millikan (21) and is of particular significance when the solute molecule is comparable in size to the discontinuities of the surrounding medium. The molecular radii of a number of small organic molecules obtained by means of the corrected Stokes-Einstein equation do not differ significantly from the radii obtained from molecular models of these compounds.},

	abstract = {Single-particle trajectories measured in microscopy experiments contain important information about dynamic processes undergoing in a range of materials including living cells and tissues. However, extracting that information is not a trivial task due to the stochastic nature of particles' movement and the sampling noise. In this paper, we adopt a deep learning method known as a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify modes of diffusion from given trajectories. We compare this fully automated approach working with raw data to classical machine learning techniques that require data preprocessing and extraction of human-engineered features from the trajectories to feed classifiers like random forest or gradient boosting. All methods are tested using simulated trajectories for which the underlying physical model is known. From the results, it follows that although the feature-based methods perform better than CNN in terms of accuracy and are computationally cheaper, the performance of CNN is already very good and may be probably improved after carrying out an expanded search for the best performing CNN model on an HPC platform.},

Over the past decade, it has been found that the ion conductivity in nanopores could be drastically enhanced, and different mechanisms have been proposed to explain this observation. To date, most reported studies have been carried out with relatively dilute electrolytes, while ion transport in nanopores under high electrolyte concentrations ({\textgreater}1 M) has been rarely explored. Through systematic experimental and atomistic simulation studies with NaCl solutions, here we show that at high electrolyte concentrations, ion mobility in small nanopores could be significantly reduced from the corresponding bulk value. Subsequent molecular dynamics studies indicate that in addition to the low mobility of surface-bound ions in the Stern layer, enhanced pairing and collisions between partially dehydrated ions of opposite charges also make important contributions to the reduced ion mobility. Furthermore, we show that the extent of mobility reduction depends on the association constant between cations and anions in different electrolytes with a more drastic reduction for a larger association constant.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the hydration structure of Na+ and K+ in the liquid phase has wide ranging implications in the field of biological chemistry. Despite numerous experimental and computational studies, even basic features such as the coordination number of these alkali ions in liquid water, thought to play a critical role in selectivity, continue to be the subject of intensive debates. Simulations based on accurate potential energy surfaces offer one approach to resolve these issues by providing reliable results on ion hydration. In this article, we report the results from molecular dynamics simulations of Na+ and K+ hydration based on a novel and rigorous strategy designed to overcome the challenges of QM/MM simulations of solvent molecules in the liquid phase. In this method, which we call Flexible Inner Region Ensemble Separator (FIRES), the ion and a fixed number of nearest water molecules form a dynamical and flexible inner region that is represented with high level ab initio quantum mechanical (QM) methods, while the water molecules from the surrounding bulk form an outer region that is represented by a polarizable molecular mechanical (MM) force field. Simulations yield rigorously correct thermodynamic averages as long as the solvent molecules in the flexible inner and outer regions are not allowed to exchange. Extensive FIRES simulations were carried out based on a QM/MM model in which the Na+ or K+ ion and the 12 nearest water molecules were represented by high level ab initio methods (RI-MP2/def2-TZVP and density functional theory with PBE/def2-TZVP), while the surrounding MM water molecules were represented by the polarizable SWM4-NDP potential. On the basis of these results, the ion coordination numbers are estimated to be within the range of 5.7–5.8 for Na+ and 6.9–7.0 for K+.},
