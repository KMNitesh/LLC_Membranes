	\section{Introduction}
	Nanostructured membrane materials have become increasingly popular for aqueous separations applications because they offer the ability to control membrane architecture at the atomic scale.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Current state-of-the-art reverse osmosis membranes are dense and unstructured with tortuous and polydisperse pores which lead to inconsistent performance
		\item Tortuosity and polydispersity drive up energy requirements which strain developing regions and contribute strongly to CO2 emissions
		\item Designing RO membranes to achieve targeted separations of specific solutes is nearly impossible due to the separation (hypothesized to be) controlled by fluctuating polymer voids
		\item RO has difficulty separating neutral organics because they tend to dissolve in polymer matrix
		\item Many current RO membranes degrade in typical chlorine filled municipal water supplies (debating this point because there aren't any studies of LLC membrane fouling resistance)  
		\item With nanostructured materials, solute rejecting pores can be tuned uniformly -- drives down energy requirements
		\item Targeted separations can be accomplished by tuning the molecular building blocks which form these materials
		\item Entirely different mechanisms govern the separation processes in various nano structured materials which can inspire novel separation techniques
	\end{itemize}
	
	Development of nanostructured materials has been limited by the ability to synthesize and scale various fundamentally sound technologies.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Leading technologies and their limitations:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Graphene sheets -atomically thick which gives excellent permeability but defects during manufacturing severely impact 
			\item Carbon Nanotubes - MD studies are promising but synthetic techniques unable to achieve necessary alignment and pore monodispersity
			%BJC: The following are ideas pulled from the grant. I need to do some reserach and come up with some one liners as to why each have not been successful
			\item Track-etch membranes
		    \item Molecular squares
			\item Macrocyclic surfactants 
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	  
	Self assembling lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) share the characteristic ability of nanostructured membrane materials to create highly ordered structures with the benefits of low cost and synthetic techniques feasible for large scale production.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item LLCs are versatile and controllable with a large chemical design space available for membrane design
		\item Synthetic techniques are cheap and amenable to creating any monomer in this large design space
		\item LLCs forms lamellar, bicontinuous cubic and hexagonal phase based on solution composition
		\item Na-GA3C11 forms two types of self assembled LLCs - thermotropic (Colh) and lyotropic (HII)
		%BJC: this is making me scratch my head - I'm afraid to talk a lot about this because of Mike's new data. But I think it's important to distinguish between what has been reported in past literature 
		\item The thermotropic, Colh, is formed by the self assembly of neat monomer
		\item The lyotropic, HII phase is formed in the presence of small amounts of water
		\item Both assemble into cylinders with hydrophilic groups oriented inward towards the pore center and hydrophobic group facing outward. The only difference is the inclusion of water in the structure which leads to minor variations in the structure with potentially different filtration properties (although no filtration experiments have been done on Colh)  
		\item Hydrophilic regions point towards pore centers
		\item Until recently, they could not be aligned - hindered progress
		\item Yale aligns them, then crosslinks them to lock in the structure - reference 2014 and 2016 papers
		\item LLC HII phase membranes offer potential for high permeability and selectivity which equals low energy consumption
		\item The Colh phase shares the same structural features with the HII phase with the exception of the presence of water. This paper will focus on the development of a model of the Colh phase since it is a simpler starting point and has just as much experimental data. The analysis used in this paper can be readily extended to the HII phase. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	A molecular level understanding of LLC membrane structure will elucidate small molecule transport mechanisms, providing guidelines for design of monomers used to create separation-specific membranes.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We do not yet understand how to reduce the effective pore size and/or tune the chemical environment in the HII nanopores for effect water desalination and small organic separations. Rejection studies show that this membrane can't do desalination
		\item We can create a molecular model that will give us the desired understanding
		\item Our focus is on Colh since it is a simpler system and has the same experimental data
		\item Colh phase studies currently limited mostly to one monomer
		\item Optimization efforts performed through trial and error
		\item Macroscopic models are the only source of predictive modeling and existing theories do not adequately describe transport at these length scales
		\item An atomistic understanding of the mechanism of solute transport can identify
		performance bottle necks and direct design of future monomers/membranes
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Do ions have trouble getting through because of interactions with other things in the pores (e.g. ions, carbonyl groups, benzene rings) -- related to ionic conduction
			\item Does concentration of ions in the pore repel incoming ions?
			\item Do neutral solutes get rejected based solely on size rejection, or do interactions within the pore lead to selective rejection
			\item Is water structured inside the pores leading to transport barriers?  
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	 
	A clear picture of the microscopic structure of LLC membranes, gained by building a molecular model, will confirm or deny past drawn conclusions that have largely guided our understanding of separation mechanisms. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The arrangement of sodium ions in the channels is thought to be confined to the pore walls. It is possible they are arranged more randomly
		\begin{itemize}
			\item This could change how one thinks about molecules diffusing through membrane
			\item Could also be a difference between lyotropic and thermotropic phases
		\end{itemize}
		\item The Colh phase is described as having pores made of disks or layers stacked on top of one another, each containing a set number of monomers. 
		\item A simple simulation study of a similar molecule (Head group is a sulfonate in the meta position) suggests that there are 4 monomers in each disk
		\item Calculations based on the volume of the liquid crystal suggest that there are seven monomers in each 
		\item We can use fourier analysis to determine if there are distinct layers, and if so, how many monomers are situated in each layer.
	\end{itemize}
	
	%MRS3: Take a pass at reprhasing this -- important to get this right. don't start with a preposition.

	We must show that the developed molecular model is physically realistic so that we can trust conclusions drawn about structural features characteristic of the system.
	%old:To trust our understanding of which structural features are most likely characteristic of the system, and the conclusions drawn thereof, we must show that our molecular model is physically realistic.   
	\begin{itemize}
		\item This paper will illustrate the careful development of a predictive molecular model and the steps taken to ensure it mimics the real system as best we can 
		\item To understand how physically realistic the model is, validation by comparison to experiment is necessary
		\item We are primarily interested in reproducing the conclusions about structure which can be made from SAXS experiments, predicting ionic conductivity with a reasonable comparison to experiment, and reproducing experimental density measurements.    
			\item We can simulate x ray diffraction patterns based on atomic coordinates
			\item We can predict ionic conductivity using two agreeing methods
			\item Density? - I will ask Mike to take more density measurements. It seems worthwhile     
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Methods}
	
	HII monomers were parameterized using the Generalized Amber Forcefield with the Antechamber package provided with AmberTools16. All molecular dynamics simulations were run using Gromacs version 5.1.2.
	
	An ensemble of characteristic, low-energy vacuum monomer configurations were constructed by applying a simulated annealing process to a parameterized monomer.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Structure cooled from 1000 to 50 K over 10 nanoseconds
		\item Result not global minimum but close enough for structure building
		\item Antechamber used for atomtyping with gaff forcefield
		\item Used Openeye Quacpac molcharge.py to assign charges
		\item Anneal again 
		\item Multiple configurations saved from annealing trajectory to prove independence of starting config
	\end{itemize}
	
	The timescale for self assembly of monomers into the hexagonal phase is unknown and likely outside of a reasonable length for an atomistic simulation, calling for a more efficient way to build the system. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Work done shows coarse grain model self assembly in ~1000 ns , Citation: J. Phys. Chem. B 2013, 117, 4254-4262
		\item Attempts with Colh system not fruitful  
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Packed monomers into box
			\item Simulated for ~100 ns with no progress shown towards self assembly
		\end{itemize}  
		\item Wrote code to assemble monomers into Colh configuration close to what is expected 
		\item Equilibration simulations allow structure to relax into expected configuration 
	\end{itemize}
	
	Each pore is made of twenty stacked monomer layers, the smallest number of layers possible without sacrificing the expected aligned hexagonal morphology.
	%Twenty monomer  per pore provides a balance of structural accuracy and computational efficiency. 
	%MRS2: describe quantitatively how you decided.  What is the information that made you make the decision?
	%BJC2: It's hard to give much quantitative back up. We decided on this with more qualitative backup. We chose 20 to be safe but probably could have gotten away with less.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Space between membrane layers in z direction - semi-isotropic sims fix z box dimension
		\item 5 layers create micellar structure
		\item Beyond 20 layers is unnecessary to get expected configuration
		\item layers spaced far enough apart to avoid large energy repulsions but close enough to prevent disks slipping between one another ~ 5 angstroms works.
	\end{itemize}
%MRS3: what is the thesis? decide what each figure is attempting to communicate to the reader.
%BJC3: Maybe i include this in the supplemental information. I don't think a picture of the initial configuration is actually that interesting or important. I can't think of a thesis for a figure that is purely illustrative 
	FIGURE: initial configuration \\
	caption: A representative initial configuration. The pores are rotated to prevent overlaps \\
	\\
	\noindent Initial guesses for the remaining structural parameters were chosen based on experimental data and treated as variables during model development 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item SAXS gives an idea of Pore-to-Pore distances
		\item TEM images and rejection studies give a pore size estimate
		\item To prevent unrealistic jumps during initial equilibration steps, the following equilibration scheme was adopted
			\begin{itemize}
			\item Apply position restraints to monomer head groups during energy minimization 
			\item Leave position restraints for npt simulations to allow tails to intermingle (this also helps ensure independence of starting configuration)
			\item Gradually reduce force constants (by square root every 50 ps) until they are completely off
			\item Run long NPT simulations at 300 K and 1 bar ( $>$200 ns ) to fully equilibrate
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	
	Using an equilibrated structure, a crosslinking procedure was performed in order to better parallel synthetic procedures. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Crosslinking maintains alignment of cylindrical mesophases - emphasize that replicating the mechanism/kinetics is not important 
		\item head to tail addition dominates so I only implemented that
		\item racemic mixture - don't have to be too concerned about direction of attack 
		\item Details of crosslinking algorithm (refer to appendix or supplemental info but give a brief overview here)
	\end{itemize}  
	
	\section{Results and Discussion}
	
	Proper selection of initial structural parameters results in an equilibrated model that is experimentally consistent 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Visual perspective \\
%MRS3: what is the thesis of the figure -- what is it trying to show.  Important when analyzing the outline and deciding what it means.  Make that the caption.
		FIGURE: shows top view and cross section (with pbcs on)\\
		%caption: (a) A top view of an equilibrated LLC membrane system shows defined pores and the expected hexagonal morphology. \\
		%(b) A side vew of an equilibrated LLC membrane system shows the straight cylindrical pores, emphasized by large blue sodium ions 
			caption: % BJC3: Attempt #2 trying to make it more thesis like. These aren't meant to do much other than show that we get, qualitatively, the same strucure described in the literature
		(a) The expected hexagonal membrane morphology is preserved upon equilibration
		(b) Straight cylindrical pore regions are present 
		\item System dimensions and properties are consistent upon equilibration using multiple monomer configurations 
		\item Pore to pore distance
		\begin{itemize}
			\item We know from SAXS data what the distance between pores should be
			\item We require long simulation times to reach an equilibrated structure with the correct dimensions
			\item Crosslinking locks in structure, maintaining pore distances even after long simulations
			\item Simulated SAXS data
		\end{itemize}
		FIGURE - perhaps a four panel figure
		(a) Experimental Small Angle X-ray scattering data shows confirms a hexagonally packed morphology and tells us the distance between pores \\
		(b) Measuring the distance between pores over time indicates equilibration when the distances stop changing \\
		(c) A crosslinked system run for 100 ns shows that the system maintains itself close to its initial position \\ 
		(d) A simulated x-ray diffraction pattern generated from atomic coordinates matches experimental measurements \\  	
		\item Pore Radius - a less reliable validation because we don't have an agreed upon way to measure this parameter experimentally
		\item Density - there are crude lab measurements which my model is in agreement with (no one has reported any values since it wasn't relevant to them)
	\end{itemize}
	
	The monomers are arranged into disks containing 5 monomers in each layer.
	%BJC: So, it looks like there is some kind of z directional order 
        
	\begin{itemize}
		\item It has been suggested that there are 4 monomers in a each disk/layer, however, simulations have shown that this leads to unstable configurations with dimensions that are too small compared to experiment.
		\item Stable simulations with 6 and 7 monomers have been performed which give structural characteristics consistent with experiment
		\item Stable systems have also been simulated consisting of varying numbers of monomers per layer
		\item Calculating the number density of components in the z direction has shown defined groups % will do for 7 monomers / layer and alternating monomers / layer
		\\ Figure \\
		(a) The number density of benzene ring centers in the z direction shows regions with higher concentrations of the component \\
		(b) A power spectrum of the data in (a) indicates that a new layer is defined every 4 angstroms implying that there are 5 monomers per layer.\\
		\item Even though there are defined regions of higher component density, there is still considerable variation in the position of the components (shown by the extra noise in the power spectrum)
		\item This suggests that the arrangement of monomers is more complicated than simple layers stacked on top of each other
		\item Density of components along Z axis \\
		\item There are not clear layers despite the defined layers in the starting configuration.
		
	\end{itemize}
	
	The arrangement of sodium counterions within the hydrophilic pore regions can be fit to a gaussian distribution. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Past literature reports ions arranged in a circle about pore walls implying some kind of void space as a pore. Simulations under a variety of conditions suggest that ions prefer disorder within the pores. 
		\item A size exclusion mechanism has been proposed in the past, however that might no be the only force at play
		\item Ions may play a role in transport, hindering flux of solute and solvent by slowing their diffusion
		\item The membrane may exhibit the permeability-selectivity tradeoff inherent to solution-diffusion type membranes.
		\\FIGURE - plot from grant - sodium, benzene, tail densities in pores
                %MRS3: again, thesis.
		caption: The densities of sodium (blue), benzene (red), and alkyl tail carbons (cyan) surrounding the membrane pore centers indicate that each the pore region is a soup of the three components opposing the previously assumed hollow region. 
	\end{itemize}	
	
	%BJC: New x-ray data here. Need higher resolution simulated data (working on it) and supporting experimental results first.
	
	The model gives reasonable estimates of ionic conductivity.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item There are a few ways to estimate ionic conductivity as seen in literature. We prefer a method which can extract an estimate based purely on an equilibrium trajectory
		\item We must also be sure that our analysis of results is consistent with the method use for experimental evaluation (i.e. AC impedance spectroscopy)
		\item We must also link our perfectly straight microscopic system to the not-so-straight macroscopic system
		\item Two methods used to for prediction
		\item Nernst Einstein Relation:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Widely used equation for estimating ionic conductivity
			\item Estimates DC ionic conductivity -- Frequency used during AC impedance slow enough to be approximated by dc at short enough timescales
			\item Relates the diffusive motion of ions in the membrane to the membrane's ionic conductivity
			\item Concentration is concentration of ions in the whole membrane, not just channels
		\end{itemize}
		\item Collective Diffusion:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Defines a collective coordinate, Q (charge), to quantify the amount of charge transfer through the system
			\item In the limit of infinite time, the MSD of Q can be used to formulate a diffusion coefficient of Q that can be related to ionic conductivity
			\item The model is valid for non-equilibrium and equilibrium simulations. Our analysis is based on the latter
			\item A similar model has been derived and validate to predict water permeability using equilibrium simulations
			\item The pore region is defined as the entire membrane system since lab IC measurements are done on bulk membrane rather than on individual pores. One would expect single channel IC to be much larger than the bulk membrane
		\end{itemize}                    
	\end{itemize}
	TABLE: Calculated ionic conductivity using Nernst-Einsten and Collective Diffusion agree within error
	\\

	The procedure used to create and validate our model can be used to evaluate other liquid crystalline assemblies. Using the design framework and analysis methods applied herin, we have the ability to reliably predict properties of new nanoporous membranes.
	
	\section{Conclusion}
	
	In this work, we have suggested a more detailed picture of the structure of a self assembled thermotropic liquid crystal membrane using an atomistic molecular model.
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The model's physical properties are consistent with experimental measurements
		\item Channels are more disordered than previously thought and are filled with organic matter rather than hollow 
		\item There are likely no defined layers
		\item Results presented for Colh phase monomer but methods are readily adapted to other LCs
