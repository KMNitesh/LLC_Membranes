	abstract = {The phase behaviour of the lyotropic liquid crystal sodium 3,4,5-tris(omega-acryloyloxyundecyloxy)-benzoate was investigated by small angle X-ray scattering. The water content of the lyotropic liquid crystal phase was varied between 8 and 20wt\% and the investigations were performed in a temperature range up to 70oC. A reversed hexagonal structure (H2-phase) as well as the isotropic phase were observed. The lattice constant of the H2-phase was found to be independent of the water content. An extremely small dependence on temperature could be found. Based on the shape of the molecules and the observed structural properties, a model for the arrangement of the molecules within the H2-phase is given. The transition temperature from the H2-phase to the isotropic phase decreases significantly from 60oC for the sample with 8wt\% water content to 30oC for the sample with 20wt\% water content.},

The structure of these films was investigated by X-ray diffraction. No change of the lattice due to the polymerisation procedure was observed. The low water content (below 10 wt.-\%) of the liquid crystals in combination with the observed hexagonal lattice reveal that a reversed hexagonal structure (H2 phase) is present. Different types of films were investigated, obtained by varying the preparation conditions of the used lyotropic liquid crystals, such as water content, type of metal-counterion and length of the monomer. The lattice constant was found to be independent of the water content. It seems that at low water content of 8 wt.-\% the lyotropic structure is still fully hydrated. This unusual behaviour is related to the tapered structure of the monomer which is composed of by a small headgroup and three extended tails for each headgroup. The lattice constant can be changed by using differently charged metal-counterions which are associated with the headgroup, as well as by varying the length of the tails on the monomer. Low resolution electron density maps of the hexagonal lattice give deeper insight in the arrangement of the monomers within the polymerised structure.},

The coupling between the various mechanisms involved in the retention phenomenon is pointed out and discussed. The volume charge density of a NF polyamide membrane is determined from tangential streaming potential measurements. The SEDE model is then used to assess the rejection rate of the membrane, the dielectric constant of the solution filling pores being the single adjustable parameter of the model. It is clearly shown that the dielectric exclusion cannot be neglected in the analysis of the filtration properties of NF membranes. Indeed, the classical steric/electric exclusion theory is found to be unable to describe experimental rejection rates of the polyamide membrane under consideration.},

An ideal nanoporous membrane would consist of a thin film with physically continuous and vertically aligned nanopores and would display a narrow distribution of pore sizes. However, the current state of the art departs considerably from this ideal and is beset by intrinsic trade-offs between permeability and selectivity. We demonstrate an effective and scalable method to fabricate polymer films with ideal membrane morphologies consisting of submicron thickness films with physically continuous and vertically aligned 1 nm pores. The approach is based on soft confinement to control the orientation of a cross-linkable mesophase in which the pores are produced by self-assembly. The scalability, exceptional ease of fabrication, and potential to create a new class of nanofiltration membranes stand out as compelling aspects.},

Here we report facile, scalabe fabrication of polymer membranes with vertically (i.e., along the through-plane direction) aligned 1 nm pores by magnetic-field alignment and subsequent cross-linking of a liquid crystalline mesophase. We utilize a wedge-shaped amphiphilic species as the building block of a thermotropic columnar mesophase with 1 nm ionic nanochannels, and leverage the magnetic anisotropy of the amphiphile to control the alignment of these pores with a magnetic field. In situ X-ray scattering and subsequent optical microscopy reveal the formation of highly ordered nanostructured mesophases and cross-linked polymer films with orientational order parameters of ca. 0.95. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging provides direct visualization of long-range persistence of vertically aligned, hexagonally packed nanopores in unprecedented detail, demonstrating high-fidelity retention of structure and alignment after photo-cross-linking. Ionic conductivity measurements on the aligned membranes show a remarkable 85-fold enhancement of conductivity over nonaligned samples. These results provide a path to achieving the large area control of morphology and related enhancement of properties required for high-performance membranes and other applications.},

	abstract = {A critical assessment of previous theoretical descriptions of membrane nanofiltration shows that the good agreement with experimental data is due to the use of the ratio of effective membrane thickness to membrane porosity as an arbitrary fitting parameter. A more rigorous analysis shows that rejection is independent of membrane thickness.

A model allowing calculation of uncharged solute rejection on the basis of a single membrane parameter (pore radius) is developed. The theoretical description is based on a hydrodynamic model of hindered solute transport in pores. The dependence of solute chemical potential on pressure is included, although its effect is shown to be small. A variation of solvent viscosity with pore radius is also included. For pores of a single size, such variation has no effect on rejection, though it will become important for overall membrane rejection if a pore size distribution is included. The good agreement between this model and experimental data confirms that uncharged solute rejection in nanofiltration membranes may be well-described by such a continuum model.

A two-parameter model (pore radius and membrane charge) for electrolyte rejection has been developed that includes dielectric exclusion in the form of an energy barrier to ion partitioning into the pores. Reassessment of the pore dielectric constant using NaCl rejection at the isoelectric point of a Desal-DK membrane resulted in significantly better agreement with experimental rejection data than use of the high frequency solvent dielectric constant for an oriented layer of water molecules at the pore walls. The predicted values of effective membrane charge density were not only significantly reduced in magnitude, and hence more realistic, than those from previous models, but their variation with concentration for divalent salts was in better agreement with physical models of ion adsorption.

The theoretical descriptions of the present paper are developed more rigorously than those previously published. Their overall agreement with experimental data is good and the resulting membrane parameters are likely to be more closely related to physical membrane properties than those obtained from previous models. The descriptions are useful for membrane process assessment and prediction. They also provide a sound basis for further developments.},

	abstract = {Throughout the world, water scarcity is being recognised as a present or future threat to human activity and as a consequence, a definite trend to develop alternative water resources such as desalination can be observed. The most commonly used desalination technologies are reverse osmosis (RO) and thermal processes such as multi-stage flash (MSF) and multi-effect distillation (MED). In Europe, reverse osmosis, due to its lower energy consumption has gained much wider acceptance than its thermal alternatives. This review summarises the current state-of-the art of reverse osmosis desalination, dealing not only with the reverse osmosis stage, but with the entire process from raw water intake to post treatment of product water. The discussion of process fundamentals, membranes and membrane modules and of current and future developments in membrane technology is accompanied by an analysis of operational issues as fouling and scaling and of measures for their prevention such as adequate cleaning procedures and antiscalant use. Special focus is placed on pre-treatment of raw water and post-treatment of brine as well as of product water to meet drinking and irrigation water standards, including evaluation of current boron removal options. Energy requirements of reverse osmosis plants as well as currently applied energy recovery systems for reduction of energy consumption are described and cost and cost structure of reverse osmosis desalination are outlined. Finally, current practices of waste management and disposal as well as new trends such as the use of hybrid plants, i.e. combining reverse osmosis with thermal processes and/or power generation are addressed.},

Distillation plants require an inlet seawater flow around 8 to 10 times the fresh water production rate, for cooling and feed make-up. The discharge is raised in salinity and in temperature, due to heat rejection from the process. A seawater RO plant generally requires a lower feedwater flow rate of around 2.5 to 3 times the production. Salinity of the discharge is correspondingly greater than in distillation, but temperature rise is small. Chemical discharges are compared for the different processes. A comparison is made of atmospheric emissions from generating the power to drive RO process pumps and the emissions resulting from generation of steam and auxiliary power for distillation (in dual purpose desalination/power plants). The factors affecting site selection and requirements for seawater intakes and outfalls are briefly discussed, with examples. The land area needed for a desalination plant is compared with the catchment and reservoir areas needed for a typical surface water collection scheme to illustrate the much lower impact of desalination on land resources.

	abstract = {The incomplete rejection of certain pesticides, disinfection by-products, endocrine disrupting compounds, and pharmaceutically active compounds has been reported during full- and pilot-scale high-pressure membrane applications. Since the removal of these compounds in water and wastewater treatment applications is of great importance where a high product water quality is desired, an understanding of the factors affecting the permeation of solutes in high-pressure membrane systems is needed. In this paper, findings of a comprehensive literature review are reported, targeting membrane rejection mechanisms and factors affecting rejection. The following key solute parameters were identified to primarily affect solute rejection: molecular weight (MW), molecular size (length and width), acid disassociation constant (pKa), hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity (log Kow), and diffusion coefficient (Dp). Key membrane properties affecting rejection that were identified include molecular weight cut-off, pore size, surface charge (measured as zeta potential), hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity (measured as contact angle), and surface morphology (measured as roughness). In addition, feed water composition, such as pH, ionic strength, hardness, and the presence of organic matter, was also identified as having an influence on solute rejection. From the knowledge gained during the literature review, a rejection diagram was proposed, which qualitatively allows prediction of solute rejection if certain solute and membrane properties are known.},

	abstract = {In pressure-driven membrane processes (reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration) a pressure exerted on the solution at one side of the membrane serves as a driving force to separate it into a permeate and a retentate. The permeate is usually pure water, whereas the retentate is a concentrated solution that must be disposed of or treated by other methods. Membranes may be polymeric, organo-mineral, ceramic, or metallic, and filtration techniques differ in pore size, from dense (no pores) to porous membranes. Depending on the type of technique, salts, small organic molecules, macromolecules, or particles can be retained, and the applied pressure will differ. This paper reviews the principles behind the different techniques, the types of membranes used, rejection mechanisms, and process modeling. Applications of pressure-driven membrane processes are also considered, including reverse osmosis and nanofiltration for the treatment of wastewater from landfills and composting plants, nanofiltration in the textile industry, and ultrafiltration and microfiltration in drinking water production and wastewater treatment. Lastly, the paper discusses recent developments, including techniques to prevent membrane fouling by modifications affecting surface roughness or hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, or by cleaning the membranes, and methods for treating or disposing of the retentate.},

	abstract = {, The hydration of the alkali metal ions in aqueous solution
has been studied by large angle X-ray scattering (LAXS) and double
difference infrared spectroscopy (DDIR). The structures of the dimethyl
sulfoxide solvated alkali metal ions in solution have been determined
to support the studies in aqueous solution. The results of the LAXS
and DDIR measurements show that the sodium, potassium, rubidium and
cesium ions all are weakly hydrated with only a single shell of water
molecules. The smaller lithium ion is more strongly hydrated, most
probably with a second hydration shell present. The influence of the
rubidium and cesium ions on the water structure was found to be very
weak, and it was not possible to quantify this effect in a reliable
way due to insufficient separation of the O–D stretching bands
of partially deuterated water bound to these metal ions and the O–D
stretching bands of the bulk water. Aqueous solutions of sodium, potassium
and cesium iodide and cesium and lithium hydroxide have been studied
by LAXS and M–O bond distances have been determined fairly
accurately except for lithium. However, the number of water molecules
binding to the alkali metal ions is very difficult to determine from
the LAXS measurements as the number of distances and the temperature
factor are strongly correlated. A thorough analysis of M–O
bond distances in solid alkali metal compounds with ligands binding
through oxygen has been made from available structure databases. There
is relatively strong correlation between M–O bond distances
and coordination numbers also for the alkali metal ions even though
the M–O interactions are weak and the number of complexes of
potassium, rubidium and cesium with well-defined coordination geometry
is very small. The mean M–O bond distance in the hydrated sodium,
potassium, rubidium and cesium ions in aqueous solution have been
determined to be 2.43(2), 2.81(1), 2.98(1) and 3.07(1) Å, which
corresponds to six-, seven-, eight- and eight-coordination. These
coordination numbers are supported by the linear relationship of the
hydration enthalpies and the M–O bond distances. This correlation
indicates that the hydrated lithium ion is four-coordinate in aqueous
solution. New ionic radii are proposed for four- and six-coordinate
lithium(I), 0.60 and 0.79 Å, respectively, as well as for five-
and six-coordinate sodium(I), 1.02 and 1.07 Å, respectively.
The ionic radii for six- and seven-coordinate K+, 1.38
and 1.46 Å, respectively, and eight-coordinate Rb+ and Cs+, 1.64 and 1.73 Å, respectively, are confirmed
from previous studies. The M–O bond distances in dimethyl sulfoxide
solvated sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium ions in solution are
very similar to those observed in aqueous solution., The hydration of alkali metal ions has been studied by large angle
X-ray scattering, LAXS, and double difference infrared spectroscopy.
The obtained M−O bond distances from LAXS have been compared
to relevant crystal structures, conclusions about hydration numbers
in aqueous solution have been made, and new ionic radii have been
proposed. Hydration numbers of six, seven, eight and eight are proposed
for the sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium ions in aqueous solution.},

	abstract = {Reverse osmosis membrane technology has developed over the past 40 years to a 44\% share in world desalting production capacity, and an 80\% share in the total number of desalination plants installed worldwide. The use of membrane desalination has increased as materials have improved and costs have decreased. Today, reverse osmosis membranes are the leading technology for new desalination installations, and they are applied to a variety of salt water resources using tailored pretreatment and membrane system design. Two distinct branches of reverse osmosis desalination have emerged: seawater reverse osmosis and brackish water reverse osmosis. Differences between the two water sources, including foulants, salinity, waste brine (concentrate) disposal options, and plant location, have created significant differences in process development, implementation, and key technical problems. Pretreatment options are similar for both types of reverse osmosis and depend on the specific components of the water source. Both brackish water and seawater reverse osmosis (RO) will continue to be used worldwide; new technology in energy recovery and renewable energy, as well as innovative plant design, will allow greater use of desalination for inland and rural communities, while providing more affordable water for large coastal cities. A wide variety of research and general information on RO desalination is available; however, a direct comparison of seawater and brackish water RO systems is necessary to highlight similarities and differences in process development. This article brings to light key parameters of an RO process and process modifications due to feed water characteristics.},

	abstract = {Reverse osmosis (RO) is currently the most important desalination technology and it is experiencing significant growth. The objective of this paper is to review the historical and current development of RO membrane materials which are the key determinants of separation performance and water productivity, and hence to define performance targets for those who are developing new RO membrane materials. The chemistry, synthesis mechanism(s) and desalination performance of various RO membranes are discussed from the point of view of membrane materials science. The review starts with the first generation of asymmetric polymeric membranes and finishes with current proposals for nano-structured membrane materials. The paper provides an overview of RO performance in relation to membrane materials and methods of synthesis.

To date polymeric membranes have dominated the RO desalination industry. From the late 1950s to the 1980s the research effort focussed on the search for optimum polymeric membrane materials. In subsequent decades the performance of RO membranes has been optimised via control of membrane formation reactions, and the use of poly-condensation catalysts and additives. The performance of state-of-the-art RO membranes has been highlighted. Nevertheless, the advances in membrane permselectivity in the past decade has been relatively slow, and membrane fouling remains a severe problem.

The emergence of nano-technology in membrane materials science could offer an attractive alternative to polymeric materials. Hence nano-structured membranes are discussed in this review including zeolite membranes, thin film nano-composite membranes, carbon nano-tube membranes, and biomimetic membranes. It is proposed that these novel materials represent the most likely opportunities for enhanced RO desalination performance in the future, but that a number of challenges remain with regard to their practical implementation.},

An organic rejection of 96.5\% with a water flux of 0.33 kg m−2 h−1 was obtained for 100 ppm pentanoic acid solution at an operation pressure of 2.76 MPa. For non-electrolyte organics, separation efficiency is governed by the molecular dynamic size; the organics with larger molecular dynamic size show higher separation efficiency. The zeolite membrane gives an organic rejection of 99.5\% and 17\% for 100 ppm toluene and 100 ppm ethanol, respectively, with a water flux of 0.03 kg m−2 h−1, 0.31 kg m−2 h−1 at an operation pressure of 2.76 MPa.

	abstract = {We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Å, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Å, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Å and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {α-Hemolysin of Staphylococcus aureus is a self-assembling toxin that forms a water-filled transmembrane channel upon oligomerization in a lipid membrane. Apart from being one of the best-studied toxins of bacterial origin, α-hemolysin is the principal component in several biotechnological applications, including systems for controlled delivery of small solutes across lipid membranes, stochastic sensors for small solutes, and an alternative to conventional technology for DNA sequencing. Through large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we studied the permeability of the α-hemolysin/lipid bilayer complex for water and ions. The studied system, composed of ∼300,000 atoms, included one copy of the protein, a patch of a DPPC lipid bilayer, and a 1 M water solution of KCl. Monitoring the fluctuations of the pore structure revealed an asymmetric, on average, cross section of the α-hemolysin stem. Applying external electrostatic fields produced a transmembrane ionic current; repeating simulations at several voltage biases yielded a current/voltage curve of α-hemolysin and a set of electrostatic potential maps. The selectivity of α-hemolysin to Cl− was found to depend on the direction and the magnitude of the applied voltage bias. The results of our simulations are in excellent quantitative agreement with available experimental data. Analyzing trajectories of all water molecule, we computed the α-hemolysin’s osmotic permeability for water as well as its electroosmotic effect, and characterized the permeability of its seven side channels. The side channels were found to connect seven His-144 residues surrounding the stem of the protein to the bulk solution; the protonation of these residues was observed to affect the ion conductance, suggesting the seven His-144 to comprise the pH sensor that gates conductance of the α-hemolysin channel.},

Increased insight into their functional mechanisms is crucial to enable drug design on this important class of membrane proteins, and to enhance our understanding of some of the fundamental features of cells. This review presents the concepts behind the recently developed simulation protocol Computational Electrophysiology (CompEL), which facilitates the atomistic simulation of ion channels in action. In addition, the review provides guidelines for its application in conjunction with the molecular dynamics software package GROMACS. We first lay out the rationale for designing CompEL as a method that models the driving force for ion permeation through channels the way it is established in cells, i.e., by electrochemical ion gradients across the membrane. This is followed by an outline of its implementation and a description of key settings and parameters helpful to users wishing to set up and conduct such simulations. In recent years, key mechanistic and biophysical insights have been obtained by employing the CompEL protocol to address a wide range of questions on ion channels and permeation. We summarize these recent findings on membrane proteins, which span a spectrum from highly ion-selective, narrow channels to wide diffusion pores. Finally we discuss the future potential of CompEL in light of its limitations and strengths. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane Proteins edited by J.C.

To better understand the current-voltage (I-V) dependence of ion channels, here we describe and prove a collective diffusion model that quantitatively relates the spontaneous ion permeation at equilibrium to the stationary ionic fluxes driven by small voltages. The model makes it possible to determine the channel conductance in the linear I-V range from equilibrium simulations without the application of a voltage. To validate the theory, we perform molecular-dynamics simulations on two channels-a conical-shaped nanopore and the transmembrane pore of an α-hemolysin-under both equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. The simulations reveal substantial couplings between the motions of cations and anions, which are effectively captured by the collective coordinate in the model. Although the two channels exhibit very different linear ranges in the I-V curves, in both cases the channel conductance at small voltages is in reasonable agreement with the prediction from the equilibrium simulation. The simulations also suggest that channel charges, rather than geometric asymmetry, play a more prominent role in current rectification.},

In order to verify that the method can determine anisotropic conductivity, novel fluorous block copolymers with various anisotropic phase segregated morphologies were evaluated. All polymer electrolyte membranes examined exhibited a Nyquist plot response in the form of a straight line with an angle of approximately 70°–80° to the Z′-axis. Interfacial capacitance, membrane bulk resistance and membrane bulk capacitance were considered as contributing parameters to the impedance of the system; high frequency inductance and contact resistance were instrumentally minimized. A marginally anisotropic conductivity (σ=/σ⊥ = 1.0–1.4) was found in all Nafion® samples. Fluorous block copolymers with disordered morphology exhibited higher conductivity in the through-plane direction by a factor of 1.4.

	abstract = {Advances in modern computational methods and technology make it possible to carry out extensive molecular dynamics simulations of complex membrane proteins based on detailed atomic models. The ultimate goal of such detailed simulations is to produce trajectories in which the behavior of the system is as realistic as possible. A critical aspect that requires consideration in the case of biological membrane systems is the existence of a net electric potential difference across the membrane. For meaningful computations, it is important to have well validated methodologies for incorporating the latter in molecular dynamics simulations. A widely used treatment of the membrane potential in molecular dynamics consists of applying an external uniform electric field E perpendicular to the membrane. The field acts on all charged particles throughout the simulated system, and the resulting applied membrane potential V is equal to the applied electric field times the length of the periodic cell in the direction perpendicular to the membrane. A series of test simulations based on simple membrane-slab models are carried out to clarify the consequences of the applied field. These illustrative tests demonstrate that the constant-field method is a simple and valid approach for accounting for the membrane potential in molecular dynamics studies of biomolecular systems.

We identify MBAR as the consistently best performing method, though other methods are frequently comparable in reliability and accuracy in many cases. We demonstrate that assumptions of Gaussian distributed errors in free energies are usually valid for most methods studied. We demonstrate that bootstrap error estimation is a robust and useful technique for estimating statistical variance for all free energy methods studied.

It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},

Over the past decade, there have been intensive and continuous efforts in the development of TFC membrane, both from the industry and academia with the interests to further improve the membrane productivity and selectivity as well as its tolerance against chlorine, solvent, fouling, etc. On basis of a brief introduction of the development history of TFC membranes, this paper reviews the recent research progress of the TFC membrane science and technology, particularly in the fields of water-related separation processes. Reviewing the research progress is imperative and necessary in order to provide an insight for the future development and perhaps open a door to extend the applications to other more challenging areas.},

Thermodynamic and mechanical properties were calculated as a function of the cross-link density. A new relative reactivity volume (RRV) algorithm was developed to generate the cross-linking network by incorporating the correct regioselectivity (head-to-tail chain propagation) and monomer reactivity ratios. This is the first application of reactivity ratios for free radical addition polymerization in MD simulations. Prior cross-linking simulations were performed on step-growth epoxy resin curing. Vinyl esters studied here cure by free radical addition copolymerization. Cross-linked networks with double bond conversions up to 98\% were achieved. Volume shrinkage, glass transition temperatures, and tensile elastic constants were calculated. Predicted Young’s moduli were compared with experimental data. This RRV method can generate other thermoset and thermoplastic systems containing different monomers, and provide an approach for handling simultaneous irreversible reactions in MD simulations.},

	abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes.},

Inner loops are generated automatically in C or Fortran at compile time, with optimizations adapted to each architecture. Assembly loops using SSE and 3DNow! Multimedia instructions are provided for x86 processors, resulting in exceptional performance on inexpensive PC workstations. The interface is simple and easy to use (no scripting language), based on standard command line arguments with self-explanatory functionality and integrated documentation. All binary files are independent of hardware endian and can be read by versions of GROMACS compiled using different floating-point precision. A large collection of flexible tools for trajectory analysis is included, with output in the form of finished Xmgr/Grace graphs.

	abstract = {This article reports on the calibration and validation of a new GROMOS-compatible parameter set 2016H66 for small organic molecules in the condensed phase. The calibration is based on 62 organic molecules spanning the chemical functions alcohol, ether, aldehyde, ketone, carboxylic acid, ester, amine, amide, thiol, sulfide, and disulfide, as well as aromatic compounds and nucleic-acid bases. For 57 organic compounds, the calibration targets are the experimental pure-liquid density ρliq and the vaporization enthalpy ΔHvap, as well as the hydration free energy ΔGwat and the solvation free energy ΔGche in cyclohexane, at atmospheric pressure and at (or close to) room temperature. The final root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) for these four quantities over the set of compounds are 32.4 kg m–3, 3.5 kJ mol–1, 4.1 kJ mol–1, and 2.1 kJ mol–1, respectively, and the corresponding average deviations (AVED) are 1.0 kg m–3, 0.2 kJ mol–1, 2.6 kJ mol–1, and 1.0 kJ mol–1, respectively. For the five nucleic-acid bases, the parametrization is performed by transferring the final 2016H66 parameters from analogous organic compounds followed by a slight readjustment of the charges to reproduce the experimental water-to-chloroform transfer free energies ΔGtrn. The final RMSD for this quantity over the five bases is 1.7 kJ mol–1, and the corresponding AVED is 0.8 kJ mol–1. As an initial validation of the 2016H66 set, seven additional thermodynamic, transport, and dielectric properties are calculated for the 57 organic compounds in the liquid phase. The agreement with experiment in terms of these additional properties is found to be reasonable, with significant deviations typically affecting either a specific chemical function or a specific molecule. This suggests that in most cases, a classical force-field description along with a careful parametrization against ρliq, ΔHvap, ΔGwat, and ΔGche results in a model that appropriately describes the liquid in terms of a wide spectrum of its physical properties.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses small-angle scattering experiments with particles in solution—i.e., the particles are nonoriented. A large number of particles contribute to the scattering and the resulting spatial average leads to a loss in information. The information contained in the three-dimensional electron density distribution is thereby reduced to the one-dimensional distance distribution function. This function is proportional to the number of lines with length, which connect any volume element i with any volume element k of the same particle. The spatial orientation of these connection lines is of no account to the function. The connection lines are weighted by the product of the number of electrons situated in the volume elements i and k, respectively. The correlation between the function and the structure of the particle is also discussed in the chapter. The connection between the distance distribution function and the measured experimental scattering curve is also shown. It is observed that the each distance between two electrons of the particle, which is part of the function, leads to an angular-dependent scattering intensity. This physical process of scattering can be mathematically expressed by a Fourier transformation, which defines the way in which the information in “real space” (distance distribution function) is transformed into “reciprocal space” (scattering function). The chapter also discusses monochromatization and the camera type developed in Graz.},

The difference between the estimated CCSD(T) basis set limit electronic binding energies for the T and PD shapes appears to amount to more than 0.3 kcal/mol, indicating the PD shape is a more stable configuration than the T shape for this dimer in the gas phase. This conclusion is further strengthened when a vibrational zero-point correction to the electronic binding energies of this dimer is made, which increases the difference between the two configurations to 0.4−0.5 kcal/mol. The binding energies of 2.4 and 2.8 kcal/mol for the T and PD configurations are in good accord with the previous experimental result from ionization potential measurement.},

Of these derivatives, only the l-alanine derivative (1) was found to form the HII phase, using N,N-dimethylformamide as the hydrophilic solvent. To our knowledge, this is one of the rare examples (if not the only example) of a Brønsted acidic amphiphile capable of forming a high-curvature LLC phase. Monomer 1 was also found to be able to direct the formation of the other amide-containing acidic derivatives into the HII phase when blended together. IR analysis revealed that intermolecular amide H-bonding near the headgroup plays a major role in the LLC assembly and structure-directing behavior of these systems.},

Soc. 1992, 114, 5729), electron-withdrawing substituents enhance binding in the benzene dimer by withdrawing electron density from the π-cloud of the substituted ring, reducing the repulsive electrostatic interaction with the nonsubstituted benzene. Conversely, electron-donating substituents donate excess electrons into the π-system and diminish the π-stacking interaction. We present computed interaction energies for the sandwich configuration of the benzene dimer and 24 substituted dimers, as well as sandwich complexes of substituted benzenes with perfluorobenzene. While the computed interaction energies correlate well with σm values for the substituents, interaction energies for related model systems demonstrate that this trend is independent of the substituted ring. Instead, the observed trends are consistent with direct electrostatic and dispersive interactions of the substituents with the unsubstituted ring.},

A united atom model is employed for the surfactants with fully atomistic counterions and water. This gemini architecture, in which two single tailed surfactants are joined through a flexible hydrophobic linker, has been shown to exhibit concentration-dependent aqueous self-assembly into lyotropic phases including hexagonal, gyroid, and lamellar morphologies. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed phases at similar amphiphile concentrations in water, including the unusual ability of these surfactants to form gyroid phases over unprecedentedly large amphiphile concentration windows. We demonstrate quantitative agreement between the predicted and experimentally observed domain spacings of these nanostructured materials. Through careful conformation analyses of the surfactant molecules, we show that the gyroid phase is electrostatically stabilized related to the lamellar phase. By starting with a lamellar phase, we show that use of a bulkier N(CH3)4+ counterion in place of Na+ drives the formation of a gyroid phase. Decreasing the charge on the surfactant headgroups by carboxylate protonation decreases the degree of order in the lamellar phase. Using our models, we show that the translational diffusion of water and the Na+ counterions is decreased by several orders of magnitude over the studied concentration range, and we attribute these effects to strong correlations between the mobile species and the surfactant headgroups.},

	abstract = {Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer.

	abstract = {Nanofiltration membranes (NF) have applications in several areas. One of the main applications has been in watertreatment for drinking water production as well as wastewater treatment. NF can either be used to treat all kinds of water including ground, surface, and wastewater or used as a pretreatment for desalination. The introduction of NF as a pretreatment is considered a breakthrough for the desalination process. NF membranes have been shown to be able to remove turbidity, microorganisms and hardness, as well as a fraction of the dissolved salts. This results in a significantly lower operating pressure and thus provides a much more energy-efficient process. Similar to other membrane processes, a major problem in NF membrane applications is fouling. Several studies have investigated the mechanisms of fouling in NF membranes and suggested methods to minimize and control the fouling of NF membranes. For NF membrane characterizations and process prediction, modeling of NF processes and the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) are very important. The ability to predict the performance of NF processes will lead to a lower number of experiments, saving of time and money, and help to understand the separation mechanisms during NF. A comprehensive review of NF in water treatments is presented including a review of the applications of NF in treating water as well as in the pretreatment process for desalination; the mechanism as well as minimization of NF membrane fouling problems; and theories for modelling and transport of salt, charged and noncharged organic compounds in NF membranes. The review will also address the application of AFM in studying the morphology of membrane surfaces as part of the NF membrane characterization.},

	abstract = {In spite of all promising perspectives for nanofiltration, not only in drinking water production but also in wastewater treatment, the food industry, the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, and many other industries, there are still some unresolved problems that slow down large-scale applications. This paper identifies six challenges for nanofiltration where solutions are still scarce: (1) avoiding membrane fouling, and possibilities to remediate, (2) improving the separation between solutes that can be achieved, (3) further treatment of concentrates, (4) chemical resistance and limited lifetime of membranes, (5) insufficient rejection of pollutants in water treatment, and (6) the need for modelling and simulation tools.
The implementation of nanofiltration in the industry is a success story because these challenges can be dealt with for many applications, whereas more research would result in many more possible applications. It is suggested that these challenges should be among the main priorities on the research agenda for nanofiltration. This paper offers an overview of the state-of-the-art in these areas, without going into details about specific observations in individual studies, but rather aiming at giving the overall picture of possible drawbacks. This leads to suggestions which direction the nanofiltration research community should follow, and where research questions can be found. Evidently, the six identified challenges are to some extent interrelated; mutual influences are explained as well as possible solutions, or possible pathways to solutions.},

	abstract = {Nanofiltration membranes (NFMs) are widely used in saline water desalination, wastewater treatment, and chemical product purification. However, conventional NFMs suffer from broad pore size distribution, which limits their applications for fine separation, especially in complete separation of molecules with slight differences in molecular size. Herein, defect-free composite NFMs with narrow pore size distribution are fabricated using a contra-diffusion method, with dopamine/polyethylenimine solution on the skin side and ammonium persulfate solution on the other side of the ultrafiltration substrate. Persulfate ions can diffuse through the ultrafiltration substrate into the other side and in situ trigger dopamine to form a codeposited coating with polyethylenimine. The codeposition is hindered on those sites completely covered by the polydopamine/polyethylenimine coating, although it is promoted at the defects or highly permeable regions because it is induced by the diffused persulfate ions. Such a “self-completion” process results in NFMs with highly uniform structures and narrow pore size distribution, as determined by their rejection of neutral solutes. These near electrically neutral NFMs show a high rejection of divalent ions with a low rejection of monovalent ions (MgCl2 rejection = 96\%, NaCl rejection = 23\%), majorly based on a steric hindrance effect. The as-prepared NFMs can be applied in molecular separation such as isolating cellulose hydrogenation products.},

In addition, the molecules that constitute the membrane are, allowed to vibrate. The effect of the important driving forces in these separations, viz., pressure, concentration, temperature and electric field strength, has been investigated. These results show that the water and methanol molecules cluster strongly around the ions in these simulations, and this plays a significant role in membrane based separations in both aqueous and methanolic solutions-an effect of which the importance was not previously recognized. In addition, studies have been made of the self-diffusion coefficients and density profiles in these systems.

	abstract = {A critical assessment of previous theoretical descriptions of membrane nanofiltration shows that the good agreement with experimental data is due to the use of the ratio of effective membrane thickness to membrane porosity as an arbitrary fitting parameter. A more rigorous analysis shows that rejection is independent of membrane thickness.
A model allowing calculation of uncharged solute rejection on the basis of a single membrane parameter (pore radius) is developed. The theoretical description is based on a hydrodynamic model of hindered solute transport in pores. The dependence of solute chemical potential on pressure is included, although its effect is shown to be small. A variation of solvent viscosity with pore radius is also included. For pores of a single size, such variation has no effect on rejection, though it will become important for overall membrane rejection if a pore size distribution is included. The good agreement between this model and experimental data confirms that uncharged solute rejection in nanofiltration membranes may be well-described by such a continuum model.
A two-parameter model (pore radius and membrane charge) for electrolyte rejection has been developed that includes dielectric exclusion in the form of an energy barrier to ion partitioning into the pores. Reassessment of the pore dielectric constant using NaCl rejection at the isoelectric point of a Desal-DK membrane resulted in significantly better agreement with experimental rejection data than use of the high frequency solvent dielectric constant for an oriented layer of water molecules at the pore walls. The predicted values of effective membrane charge density were not only significantly reduced in magnitude, and hence more realistic, than those from previous models, but their variation with concentration for divalent salts was in better agreement with physical models of ion adsorption.
The theoretical descriptions of the present paper are developed more rigorously than those previously published. Their overall agreement with experimental data is good and the resulting membrane parameters are likely to be more closely related to physical membrane properties than those obtained from previous models. The descriptions are useful for membrane process assessment and prediction. They also provide a sound basis for further developments.},

Despite its fundamental clinical importance, the mechanism of amyloid formation is not fully understood. When we analyzed a variety of short functional fragments from unrelated amyloid-forming proteins, a remarkable occurrence of aromatic residues was observed. The finding of aromatic residues in diverse fragments raises the possibility that π-π interactions may play a significant role in the molecular recognition and self-assembly processes that lead to amyloid formation. This is in line with the well-known central role of π-stacking interactions in self-assembly processes in the fields of chemistry and biochemistry. We speculate that the stacking interactions may provide energetic contribution as well as order and directionality in the self-assembly of amyloid structures. Experimental data regarding amyloid formation and inhibition by short peptide analogs also support our hypothesis. The π-stacking hypothesis suggests a new approach to understanding the self-assembly mechanism that governs amyloid formation and indicates possible ways to control this process.—Gazit, E.

The hybrid functional includes an ad hoc mixture of half the exact (HF) exchange with half of the uniform electron gas exchange, plus Lee, Yang, and Parr's expression for correlation energy. This functional, in combination with polarized, diffuse basis sets, gives a binding energy for the parallel-displaced benzene dimer in good agreement with the best available high-level calculations reported in the literature, and qualitatively reproduces the local MP2 potential energy surface of the parallel-displaced benzene dimer. This method was further critically compared to high-level calculations recently reported in the literature for a range of π-stacked complexes, including monosubstituted benzene–benzene dimers, along with DNA and RNA bases, and generally agrees with MP2 and/or CCSD(T) results to within ±2 kJ mol−1. We also show that the resulting BH\&H binding energy is closely related to the electron density in the intermolecular region. The net result is that the BH\&H functional, presumably due to fortuitous cancellation of errors, provides a pragmatic, computationally efficient quantum mechanical tool for the study of large π-stacked systems such as DNA. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {The effects of log-normal pore size distributions on the rejection of uncharged solutes and NaCl at hypothetical nanofiltration membranes have been assessed theoretically. The importance of pore radius-dependent properties such as solvent viscosity and dielectric constant is increased by the introduction of a pore size distribution in calculations. However, the effect of porewise variation in viscosity is less apparent when considered at a defined applied pressure rather than at a defined flux, showing a further advantage of basing theoretical analysis of nanofiltration in terms of applied pressure.
Truncated pore size distributions gave better agreement than full distributions with experimental rejection data for a Desal-DK nanofiltration membrane. Such truncation is in agreement with the findings of atomic force microscopy (AFM). Analysis of uncharged solute rejection data alone could not give useful information about membrane pore size distribution. Neither could such a distribution be obtained quantitatively directly from AFM images. However, use of the shape of the distribution obtained by AFM in conjunction with experimental rejection data for an uncharged solute allows calculation of corrected distributions. Importantly, incorporation of such a corrected pore size distribution in calculations of NaCl rejection gave better agreement with experimental data, compared to calculations assuming uniform pores, at high pressure, the region of industrial interest.},

The hybrid functional includes an ad hoc mixture of half the exact (HF) exchange with half of the uniform electron gas exchange, plus Lee, Yang, and Parr's expression for correlation energy. This functional, in combination with polarized, diffuse basis sets, gives a binding energy for the parallel-displaced benzene dimer in good agreement with the best available high-level calculations reported in the literature, and qualitatively reproduces the local MP2 potential energy surface of the parallel-displaced benzene dimer. This method was further critically compared to high-level calculations recently reported in the literature for a range of π-stacked complexes, including monosubstituted benzene–benzene dimers, along with DNA and RNA bases, and generally agrees with MP2 and/or CCSD(T) results to within ±2 kJ mol−1. We also show that the resulting BH\&H binding energy is closely related to the electron density in the intermolecular region. The net result is that the BH\&H functional, presumably due to fortuitous cancellation of errors, provides a pragmatic, computationally efficient quantum mechanical tool for the study of large π-stacked systems such as DNA. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {A thin-film composite, bicontinuous cubic lyotropic liquid crystal polymer (TFC QI) membrane with uniform-size, ionic nanopores was studied for the treatment of hydraulic fracturing flowback water. The TFC QI membrane performance was compared to those of a commercial nanofiltration (NF) membrane (NF270) and a commercial reverse osmosis (RO) membrane (SW30HR) for the filtration of flowback water from the Denver-Julesburg Basin. The permeability, salt rejection, and organic solute rejection for each membrane was evaluated. The results illustrate that the TFC QI membrane maintained its performance to a similar degree as the commercial NF and RO membranes while demonstrating a unique selectivity not observed in the commercial membranes. Specifically, the TFC QI membrane rejected 75\% of the salt while recovering 9.6\% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 50\% of the water. Of particular interest was the recovery of labile DOC, which was assessed through biodegradation experiments. Analysis following biodegradation of the TFC QI membrane permeate demonstrates the membrane's ability to recover labile DOC in a reduced-saline permeate. Improved recovery of labile DOC (increased to 22\%) was demonstrated by reducing the pH of the flowback water. Therefore, the selectivity of the TFC QI membrane provides an opportunity to recover resources from hydraulic fracturing flowback.},

	abstract = {The aliphatic chains of many biologically important lipids are heterogeneous and often related to the functions of the molecules. Certain phospholipids containing arachidonic acid may serve as precursors for prostaglandins, certain diglycerides may serve as second messengers for certain membrane-triggered reactions (43), and other phospholipids containing a very short chain in the two position may serve as vasoactive hormones (44). The packing of such molecules is of interest. The evidence is quite clear from both the conformation of saturated and unsaturated molecules and from mixing experiments in the solid state that long and short chains don't mix well, nor do unsaturated and saturated chains, even if they are of the same chain length. There is even some evidence to indicate that some degree of chain segregation occurs even in the liquid state. However, different chains are often associated through covalent bonds, e.g., in wax esters, diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, and phospholipids. A variety of possibilities for chain segregation are present in the neat phases of wax esters, ceramides, diacylglycerols, and triacylglycerols. However, in the unique case of membrane lipids like phospholipids or sphingolipids, the two chains are forced to lie side by side by virtue of the interaction of the polar group with water, and thus interactions between different chains must occur. Most of the evidence suggests that, when a solid phase results in these systems, the nonspecific chain packing mode (hexagonal chain packing) is preferred. In fact, for all of the phospholipids studied thus far, clearcut evidence of specific chain-chain interaction in molecules having both unsaturated and saturated chains has never been observed. However, for mixed chain triacylglycerols, evidence of specific chain-chain interactions (beta' and even beta) has been found and some suggestions have been given as to how this might occur through chain segregation mechanisms in the neat state. The literature suggests that further work needs to be done on the interaction of different chains that are covalently linked to the same molecule. Such studies will lead to a better understanding of the structure of lipid bilayers, membranes, lipoproteins, and lipid deposits.},

Track-etch membranes offer distinct advantages over conventional membranes due to their precisely determined structure. Their pore size, shape and density can be varied in a controllable manner so that a membrane with the required transport and retention characteristics can be produced. The use of heavy ion accelerators made it possible to vary LET of track-forming particles, angle distribution of pore channels and pore lengths. So far the track formation and etching process has been studied in much detail for several polymeric materials. Today we understand determining factors and have numerous empirical data enabling us to manufacture any particular product based on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polycarbonate (PC) films. Pore shape can be made cylindrical, conical, funnel-like, or cigar-like at will. A number of modification methods has been developed for creating TMs with special properties and functions. Applications of “conventional” track membranes can be categorized into three groups: process filtration, cell culture, and laboratory filtration. The use in biology stands out among other areas. Nuclear track pores find diverse applications as model systems and as templates for the synthesis of micro- and nanostructures.},

The explanation for macrovoid formation assumes local conditions of delayed demixing in front of a certain layer of nuclei already formed, due to a change in the interfacial compositions at the advancing coagulation front, as compared to the original composition at the interface film-bath. Effects of variations in membrane formation conditions which can be calculated using the model of diffusive mass transport in thin films of polymeric solutions in combination with phase separation in phase-inversion membranes, completely support the mechanism as proposed.},

Hand-cast pure polyamide membranes exhibit surface morphologies characteristic of commercial polyamide RO membranes, whereas nanocomposite membranes have measurably smoother and more hydrophilic, negatively charged surfaces. At the highest nanoparticle loadings tested, hand-cast nanocomposite film morphology is visibly different and pure water permeability is nearly double that of hand-cast polyamide membranes with equivalent solute rejections. Comparison of membranes formed using pore-filled and pore-opened zeolites suggest nanoparticle pores play an active role in water permeation and solute rejection. The best performing nanocomposite membranes exhibit permeability and rejection characteristics comparable to commercial RO membranes. As a concept, thin film nanocomposite membrane technology may offer new degrees of freedom in tailoring RO membrane separation performance and material properties.},

Long alkanes, such as tetradecane and hexadecane, increase the transition temperature of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, while the X-ray data indicate that these long alkanes align parallel to the lipid acyl chains. In contrast, shorter alkanes, such as hexane and octane, decrease and broaden the thermal transition and electron density profiles show that these alkanes increase bilayer width by partitioning between the apposing monolayers of the bilayer.

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are well established for the study of biomolecular systems. Within these simulations, energy functions known as force fields are used to determine the forces acting on atoms and molecules. While these force fields have been very successful, they contain a number of approximations, included to overcome limitations in computing power. One of the most important of these approximations is the omission of polarizability, the process by which the charge distribution in a molecule changes in response to its environment. Since polarizability is known to be important in many biochemical situations, and since advances in computer hardware have reduced the need for approximations within force fields, there is major interest in the use of force fields that include an explicit representation of polarizability. As such, a number of polarizable force fields have been under development: these have been largely experimental, and their use restricted to specialized researchers. This situation is now changing. Parameters for fully optimized polarizable force fields are being published, and associated code incorporated into standard simulation software. Simulations on the hundred-nanosecond timescale are being reported, and are now within reach of all simulation scientists. In this overview, I examine the polarizable force fields available for the simulation of biomolecules, the systems to which they have been applied, and the benefits and challenges that polarizability can bring. In considering future directions for development of polarizable force fields, I examine lessons learnt from non-polarizable force fields, and highlight issues that remain to be addressed.
