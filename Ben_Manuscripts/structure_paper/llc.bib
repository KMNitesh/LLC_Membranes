	abstract = {The phase behaviour of the lyotropic liquid crystal sodium 3,4,5-tris(omega-acryloyloxyundecyloxy)-benzoate was investigated by small angle X-ray scattering. The water content of the lyotropic liquid crystal phase was varied between 8 and 20wt\% and the investigations were performed in a temperature range up to 70oC. A reversed hexagonal structure (H2-phase) as well as the isotropic phase were observed. The lattice constant of the H2-phase was found to be independent of the water content. An extremely small dependence on temperature could be found. Based on the shape of the molecules and the observed structural properties, a model for the arrangement of the molecules within the H2-phase is given. The transition temperature from the H2-phase to the isotropic phase decreases significantly from 60oC for the sample with 8wt\% water content to 30oC for the sample with 20wt\% water content.},

	abstract = {Nanostructured free-standing films were obtained by polymerisation of lyotropic liquid crystal phases based on the monomer 3,4,5-tris(11′-acryloyloxyundecyloxy)benzoate. The structure of these films was investigated by X-ray diffraction. No change of the lattice due to the polymerisation procedure was observed. The low water content (below 10 wt.-\%) of the liquid crystals in combination with the observed hexagonal lattice reveal that a reversed hexagonal structure (H2 phase) is present. Different types of films were investigated, obtained by varying the preparation conditions of the used lyotropic liquid crystals, such as water content, type of metal-counterion and length of the monomer. The lattice constant was found to be independent of the water content. It seems that at low water content of 8 wt.-\% the lyotropic structure is still fully hydrated. This unusual behaviour is related to the tapered structure of the monomer which is composed of by a small headgroup and three extended tails for each headgroup. The lattice constant can be changed by using differently charged metal-counterions which are associated with the headgroup, as well as by varying the length of the tails on the monomer. Low resolution electron density maps of the hexagonal lattice give deeper insight in the arrangement of the monomers within the polymerised structure.},

It is demonstrated that, as in the aquaporins, asymmetrically positioned charges cannot generate robust unidirectional water flow in the CNT. Thermal fluctuation in bulk water competes with charge affinity to steer the water transport, resulting in nonmonotonic flow with intermittent reversal of transport direction. The energetic analysis suggests that the water-water interaction, determined by dipole orientation configuration, influences the transport rate significantly. These findings can provide correct biomimic understanding of water transport properties and will benefit the design of efficient functional nanofluidic devices.},

Using molecular dynamics simulations we investigate water flow in (16,16) CNTs and show that the enhanced flow rates over Hagen-Poiseuille flow arise from a velocity "jump" in a depletion region at the water nanotube interface and that the water orientations and hydrogen bonding at the interface significantly affect the flow rates. For nanotube with the same smooth wall structure but with more hydrophilic Lennard-Jones (LJ) parameters of silicon, the enhancement is greatly reduced because it does not have "free" OH bonds pointing to the wall as in CNTs that would reduce the number of hydrogen bonds in the depletion layer. Roughness in the tube walls causes strong hydrogen-bonding network and no significant flow enhancement is attained in rough tubes.},

	abstract = {Biological pores regulate the cellular traffic of a large variety of solutes, often with high selectivity and fast flow rates. These pores share several common structural features: the inner surface of the pore is frequently lined with hydrophobic residues, and the selectivity filter regions often contain charged functional groups. Hydrophobic, narrow-diameter carbon nanotubes can provide a simplified model of membrane channels by reproducing these critical features in a simpler and more robust platform. Previous studies demonstrated that carbon nanotube pores can support a water flux comparable to natural aquaporin channels. Here, we investigate ion transport through these pores using a sub-2-nm, aligned carbon nanotube membrane nanofluidic platform. To mimic the charged groups at the selectivity region, we introduce negatively charged groups at the opening of the carbon nanotubes by plasma treatment. Pressure-driven filtration experiments, coupled with capillary electrophoresis analysis of the permeate and feed, are used to quantify ion exclusion in these membranes as a function of solution ionic strength, pH, and ion valence. We show that carbon nanotube membranes exhibit significant ion exclusion that can be as high as 98\% under certain conditions. Our results strongly support a Donnan-type rejection mechanism, dominated by electrostatic interactions between fixed membrane charges and mobile ions, whereas steric and hydrodynamic effects appear to be less important.},

The estimated diffusion coefficient of ?100 nm2 s?1 is significantly slower than expected from viscous effects alone, possibly because of the internal degrees of freedom of the protein.

In the simulations, the cyclic peptide caused large perturbations in the bilayer and cooperatively opened a disordered toroidal pore, 1-2 nm in diameter. Electrophysiology measurements confirm discrete poration events of comparable size. We also show that lysine residues aligning parallel to each other in the cyclic but not linear peptide are crucial for function. By employing dual-color fluorescence burst analysis, we show that both peptides are able to fuse/aggregate liposomes but only the cyclic peptide is able to porate them.

	abstract = {Confinement of matter on the nanometre scale can induce phase transitions not seen in bulk systems. In the case of water, so-called drying transitions occur on this scale as a result of strong hydrogen-bonding between water molecules, which can cause the liquid to recede from nonpolar surfaces to form a vapour layer separating the bulk phase from the surface. Here we report molecular dynamics simulations showing spontaneous and continuous filling of a nonpolar carbon nanotube with a one-dimensionally ordered chain of water molecules. Although the molecules forming the chain are in chemical and thermal equilibrium with the surrounding bath, we observe pulse-like transmission of water through the nanotube. These transmission bursts result from the tight hydrogen-bonding network inside the tube, which ensures that density fluctuations in the surrounding bath lead to concerted and rapid motion along the tube axis. We also find that a minute reduction in the attraction between the tube wall and water dramatically affects pore hydration, leading to sharp, two-state transitions between empty and filled states on a nanosecond timescale. These observations suggest that carbon nanotubes, with their rigid nonpolar structures, might be exploited as unique molecular channels for water and protons, with the channel occupancy and conductivity tunable by changes in the local channel polarity and solvent conditions.},

This has enabled the investigation of numerous compounds with this architecture, and ligands with a wide variety of interesting biological targets have thus been discovered. Furthermore, detailed biophysical and structural studies focusing on the investigation of the conformational space adopted and three-dimensional folding of these peptide mimics have been undertaken. The same is true for beta-peptides (i.e., oligomers composed of beta-amino acids). Since the first publication describing peptide mimics combining these two structural modifications [the N-alkyl-beta-alanines (beta-peptoids)] in 1998, on the other hand, the application of this backbone construct has appeared much more sparsely in the literature. The present perspective article will provide an overview of the data obtained for beta-peptoid-containing peptide mimics as well as a discussion of the future challenges associated with this type of backbone modification.},

	abstract = {Limited searching in the conformational space is one of the major obstacles for investigating protein dynamics by numerical approaches. For this reason, classical all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins tend to be confined to local energy minima, particularly when the bulk solvent is treated explicitly. To overcome this problem, we have developed a novel replica exchange protocol that uses modified force-field parameters to treat interparticle nonbonded potentials within the protein and between protein and solvent atoms, leaving unperturbed those relative to solventsolvent interactions. We have tested the new protocol on the 18-residue-long tip of the P domain of calreticulin in an explicit solvent. With only eight replicas, we have been able to considerably enhance the conformational space sampled during a 100 ns simulation, compared to as many parallel classical molecular dynamics simulations of the same length or to a single one lasting 450 ns. A direct comparison between the various simulations has been possible thanks to the implementation of the weighted histogram analysis method, by which conformations simulated with modified force-field parameters can be assigned different weights. Interatom, inter-residue distances in the structural ensembles obtained with our novel replica exchange approach and by classical MD simulations compare equally well with those derived from NMR data. Rare events, such as unfolding and refolding, occur with reasonable statistical frequency. Visiting of conformations characterized by very small Boltzmann weights is also possible. Despite their low probability, such regions of the conformational space may play an important role in the search for local potential-energy minima and in dynamically controlled functions.},

The transport mechanisms were investigated by using three probe molecules: nitrogen, water, and toluene. While a barrier effect appears clearly with nitrogen, this effect changes with the amount of fillers for water and disappears for toluene. The reduction of permeability for nitrogen is mainly due to the increase of tortuosity. For water and toluene, the permeation kinetics reveals many concomitant phenomena responsible for the permeation behavior. Despite the tortuosity effect, the toluene permeability of nanocomposites increases with C30B fraction. The water and toluene molecules interact differently with fillers according to their hydrophilic/hydrophobic character. Moreover, the plasticization effect of water and toluene in the matrix, involving a concentration-dependent diffusion coefficient, is correctly described by the law D = D0eγC. On the basis of Nielsen’s tortuosity concept, we suggest a new approach for relative permeability modeling, not only based on the geometrical parameters (aspect ratio, orientation, recovery) but also including phenomenological parameters deduced from structural characterization and permeation kinetics.},

Despite a shaky early history, computer-aided drug design techniques can now be effective in reducing costs and speeding up drug discovery. This happy outcome results from development of more accurate and reliable algorithms, use of more thoughtfully planned strategies to apply them, and greatly increased computer power to allow studies with the necessary reliability to be performed. Our review focuses on applications and protocols, with the main emphasis on critical analysis of recent studies where docking calculations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were combined to dock small molecules into protein receptors. We highlight successes to demonstrate what is possible now, but also point out drawbacks and future directions. The review is structured to lead the reader from the simpler to more compute-intensive methods. Thus, while inexpensive and fast docking algorithms can be used to scan large compound libraries and reduce their size, more accurate but expensive MD simulations can be applied when a few selected ligand candidates remain. MD simulations can be used: during the preparation of the protein receptor before docking, to optimize its structure and account for protein flexibility; for the refinement of docked complexes, to include solvent effects and account for induced fit; to calculate binding free energies, to provide an accurate ranking of the potential ligands; and in the latest developments, during the docking process itself to find the binding site and correctly dock the ligand a priori. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	abstract = {Drug discovery is a highly complex and costly process, which demands integrated efforts in several relevant aspects involving innovation, knowledge, information, technologies, expertise, R\&D investments and management skills. The shift from traditional to genomics- and proteomics-based drug research has fundamentally transformed key R\&D strategies in the pharmaceutical industry addressed to the design of new chemical entities as drug candidates against a variety of biological targets. Therefore, drug discovery has moved toward more rational strategies based on our increasing understanding of the fundamental principles of protein-ligand interactions. The combination of available knowledge of several 3D protein structures with hundreds of thousands of small-molecules have attracted the attention of scientists from all over the world for the application of structure- and ligand-based drug design approaches. In this context, virtual screening technologies have largely enhanced the impact of computational methods applied to chemistry and biology and the goal of applying such methods is to reduce large compound databases and to select a limited number of promising candidates for drug design. This review provides a perspective of the utility of virtual screening in drug design and its integration with other important drug discovery technologies such as high-throughput screening (HTS) and QSAR, highlighting the present challenges, limitations, and future perspectives in medicinal chemistry.

	abstract = {The ability to finely tune the solution viscosity of an aqueous system is critical in many applications ranging from large-scale fluid-based industrial processes to free-standing hydrogels important in regenerative medicine, controlled drug delivery, and ‘green’ self-healing materials. Herein we demonstrate the use of the macrocyclic host molecule cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) to facilitate reversible cross-linking of multivalent copolymers with high binding constants (Ka {\textgreater} 1011−1012 M−2) leading to a supramolecular hydrogel. Multivalent copolymers were prepared by free radical polymerization techniques and contained either pendant methyl viologen (a good first guest for CB[8]) or naphthoxy derivatives (good second guests for CB[8]). A colorless solution of the two multivalent copolymers bearing first and second guests, respectively, can be transformed into a highly viscous, colored supramolecular hydrogel with the cross-link density being easily controlled through CB[8] addition. Moreover, the cross-links (1:1:1 supramolecular ternary complexes of CB[8]/viologen/naphthoxy) are dynamic and stimuli-responsive, and the material properties can be modulated by temperature or other external stimuli. Rheological characterization of the bulk material properties of these dynamically cross-linked networks provided insight into the kinetics of CB[8] ternary complexation responsible for elastically active cross-linking with a second guest dissociation rate constant (kd) of 1200 s−1 for the ternary complex. These materials exhibited intermediate mechanical properties at 5 wt \% in water (plateau modulus = 350−600 Pa and zero-shear viscosity = 5−55 Pa·s), which is complementary to existing supramolecular hydrogels. Additionally, these supramolecular hydrogels exhibited thermal reversibility and subsequent facile modulation of microstructure upon further addition of CB[8] and thermal treatment. The fundamental knowledge gained from the study of these dynamic materials will facilitate progress in the field of smart, self-healing materials, self-assembled hydrogels, and controlled solution viscosity.},

In a previous paper, the binding to aspartyl-tRNA synthetase of the substrate Asp and the analogue Asn were compared by molecular dynamics free energy simulations. Molecular dynamics combined with Poisson-Boltzmann free energy calculations represent a less expensive approach, suitable for examining multiple active site mutations in an engineering effort. Here, Poisson-Boltzmann free energy calculations for aspartyl-tRNA synthetase are first validated by their ability to reproduce selected molecular dynamics binding free energy differences, then used to examine the possibility of Asn binding to native and mutant aspartyl-tRNA synthetase. A component analysis of the Poisson-Boltzmann free energies is employed to identify specific interactions that determine the binding affinities. The combined use of molecular dynamics free energy simulations to study one binding process thoroughly, followed by molecular dynamics and Poisson-Boltzmann free energy calculations to study a series of related ligands or mutations is proposed as a paradigm for protein or ligand design. The binding of Asn in an alternate, "head-to-tail" orientation observed in the homologous asparagine synthetase is analyzed, and found to be more stable than the "Asp-like" orientation studied earlier. The new orientation is probably unsuitable for catalysis. A conserved active site lysine (Lys198 in Escherichia coli) that recognizes the Asp side-chain is changed to a leucine residue, found at the corresponding position in asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase. It is interesting that the binding of Asp is calculated to increase slightly (rather than to decrease), while that of Asn is calculated, as expected, to increase strongly, to the same level as Asp binding. Insight into the origin of these changes is provided by the component analyses. The double mutation (K198L,D233E) has a similar effect, while the triple mutation (K198L,Q199E,D233E) reduces Asp binding strongly. No binding measurements are available, but the three mutants are known to have no ability to adenylate Asn, despite the "Asp-like" binding affinities calculated here. In molecular dynamics simulations of all three mutants, the Asn ligand backbone shifts by 1-2 A compared to the experimental Asp:AspRS complex, and significant side-chain rearrangements occur around the pocket. These could reduce the ATP binding constant and/or the adenylation reaction rate, explaining the lack of catalytic activity in these complexes. Finally, Asn binding to AspRS with neutral K198 or charged H449 is considered, and shown to be less favorable than with the charged K198 and neutral H449 used in the analysis.},

	abstract = {Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) have proven efficacy against human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). However, in the setting of incomplete viral suppression, efavirenz and nevirapine select for resistant viruses. The diarylpyrimidine etravirine has demonstrated durable efficacy for patients infected with NNRTI-resistant HIV-1. A screening strategy used to test NNRTI candidates from the same series as etravirine identified TMC278 (rilpivirine). TMC278 is an NNRTI showing subnanomolar 50\% effective concentrations (EC50 values) against wild-type HIV-1 group M isolates (0.07 to 1.01 nM) and nanomolar EC50 values against group O isolates (2.88 to 8.45 nM). Sensitivity to TMC278 was not affected by the presence of most single NNRTI resistance-associated mutations (RAMs), including those at positions 100, 103, 106, 138, 179, 188, 190, 221, 230, and 236. The HIV-1 site-directed mutant with Y181C was sensitive to TMC278, whereas that with K101P or Y181I/V was resistant. In vitro, considerable cross-resistance between TMC278 and etravirine was observed. Sensitivity to TMC278 was observed for 62\% of efavirenz- and/or nevirapine-resistant HIV-1 recombinant clinical isolates. TMC278 inhibited viral replication at concentrations at which first-generation NNRTIs could not suppress replication. The rates of selection of TMC278-resistant strains were comparable among HIV-1 group M subtypes. NNRTI RAMs emerging in HIV-1 under selective pressure from TMC278 included combinations of V90I, L100I, K101E, V106A/I, V108I, E138G/K/Q/R, V179F/I, Y181C/I, V189I, G190E, H221Y, F227C, and M230I/L. E138R was identified as a new NNRTI RAM. These in vitro analyses demonstrate that TMC278 is a potent next-generation NNRTI, with a high genetic barrier to resistance development.},

	abstract = {Resistance to antiretroviral drugs is one of the major pitfalls of combined treatment of HIV infection. Thus, timely identification of drug resistant HIV strains and precise evaluation of the level of resistance to the different antiretroviral drugs are crucial in the management of treated patients. Phenotypic determination of antiretroviral drug resistance evaluates the ability of an HIV strain to replicate in the presence of drug(s). Thus, this assay (either conventional or recombinant) provides a direct estimate of drug susceptibility. However, it is relatively difficult to perform and requires dedicated facilities. Thus, its use is still restricted. Genotypic determination of drug resistance is based upon detection of specific mutations in HIV genes encoding target enzymes or receptors. The assay provides an indirect evidence of drug susceptibility. However, it is easy to perform and does not require dedicated facilities. Thus, it is widely utilized in clinical practice. Its major limitation concerns the complexity of results interpretation which still awaits a general consensus. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

	abstract = {Almost fifteen years ago, the first non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NNRTI) lead compounds have been discovered. Nowadays, three NNRTIs are approved for treatment of HIV-1-infected individuals and several others are subject of (advanced) clinical trials. Although the NNRTIs target HIV-1 RT, they are clearly different from the nucleoside RT inhibitors (NRTIs). They are highly selective for HIV-1 and do not inhibit HIV-2 or any other (retro)virus. They target HIV-1 RT by a direct interaction without the need to be metabolised by cellular enzymes, and they interact at a site on the HIV-1 RT that is near to, but distant from, the substrate-binding site. The majority of NNRTIs share common conformational properties and structural features that let them fit in a hydrophobic pocket at the HIV-1 RT, which is nowadays well-characterized. A wide variety of crystal structures of RT complexed with NNRTIs have been obtained. They provide detailed insights in the molecular interaction of the NNRTIs with the amino acids lining the pocket in HIV-1 RT. Due to their unprecedented specificity, the NNRTIs are relatively non-toxic in cell culture, and the most potent compounds reach selectivity indices that exceed 100,000 or more. However, inherent to their high specificity, the NNRTIs easily select for mutant virus strains with several degrees of drug resistance. The first-generation NNRTIs such as nevirapine and delavirdine easily loose their inhibitory potential against mutant virus strains that contain single amino acid mutations in their RT. The second-generation NNRTIs such as efavirenz, capravirine and dapivirine usually require two or more mutations in the HIV-1 RT before significantly decreasing their antiviral potency. Evidently, it requires a markedly longer time period to obtain significant resistance against second-generation NNRTIs. The resistance spectrum of NNRTIs is entirely different from the NRTI resistance spectrum, and, as a rule, NRTI-resistant mutant virus strains keep full sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of NNRTIs, and vice versa NNRTI-resistant and mutant virus strains keep full sensitivity to the inhibitory effects of NRTIs. NNRTIs have proven beneficial when included in drug combination (triple or quadruple) therapy, preferably in the presence of protease inhibitors and NRTIs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Application of dynamics using a multiple topology approach resulted in trapping in local minima. To extend the method to these cases, a new restraining potential was devised and added to the extended Hamiltonian. Two approximations were introduced in order to estimate the binding free energy within small simulation times using this potential: (a) The entropy terms related to the restraining potential are assumed to cancel, due to the similarity of the ligands. (b) The restraining potential calculated from the coordinates of the environmental atoms during a -dynamics simulation is assumed to be equal to that of the average coordinates. Relatively short -dynamics simulations with this restraining potential successfully yielded reasonable estimates of the binding affinity of the ligands as compared with both experimental data and free energy perturbation calculations. Long time -dynamics simulations with a ten-ligand system revealed that better ligands tend to have small statistical errors, which is appropriate for screening out the plausible ligands from all candidates. Furthermore, short time -dynamics simulations with ten identical ligands demonstrated that sufficient precision was achieved for putative discovery of tight binding ligands or guests.},

Application of lambda-dynamics to this system gives a reasonable estimate of the binding affinity of the ligands. This methodology also provides a means to explore the binding orientations and conformations of the ligands inside the binding pocket much better than does conventional MD. This is due to the scaling of forces inherent in the it-dynamics method, which lowers the barriers separating different binding modes and conformations. Examination of the lambda-dynamics trajectory of the ligands revealed alternative binding orientations and conformations not detected by crystallography. Furthermore, a lambda-dynamics simulation starting from random initial orientations, in which some li,ligands take significantly different orientations as compared with those from the X-ray structure, successfully samples the X-ray crystallographic orientations in all ligands. Ligand sampling by conventional MD starting from same initial structures remains trapped in the local minima from which they start. Such efficient sampling of ligand orientations and conformations is expected to diminish the limitation that an initial ligand structure must be close to its true bound orientation in order to yield a reasonable estimate of the binding free energy.},

The top-ranked 100 compounds from the docking for both proteins were post-scored with a procedure using molecular mechanics and continuum solvation (MM-GB/SA). The validity of the virtual screening protocol was supported by (i) testing of the MM-GB/SA procedure, (ii) agreement between predicted and crystallographic binding poses, (iii) recovery of known potent NNRTIs at the top of both rankings, and (iv) identification of top-scoring library compounds that are close in structure to recently reported NNRTI HTS hits.

The influenza virus NS1 protein is a multifunctional facilitator of virus replication, one of whose actions is to antagonize the interferon response. Since NS1 is required for efficient virus replication, it was reasoned that chemical inhibitors of this protein could be used to further understand virus-host interactions and also serve as potential new antiviral agents. A yeast-based assay was developed to identify compounds that phenotypically suppress NS1 function. Several such compounds exhibited significant activity specifically against influenza A virus in cell culture but had no effect on the replication of another RNA virus, respiratory syncytial virus. Interestingly, cells lacking an interferon response were drug resistant, suggesting that the compounds block interactions between NS1 and the interferon system. Accordingly, the compounds reversed the inhibition of beta interferon mRNA induction during infection, which is known to be caused by NS1. In addition, the compounds blocked the ability of NS1 protein to inhibit double-stranded RNA-dependent activation of a transfected beta interferon promoter construct. The effects of the compounds were specific to NS1, because they had no effect on the ability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus papainlike protease protein to block beta interferon promoter activation. These data demonstrate that the function of NS1 can be modulated by chemical inhibitors and that such inhibitors will be useful as probes of biological function and as starting points for clinical drug development.},

Structures of HIV-1 RT, usually determined at [∼]2.5-3.0 A resolution, are important for understanding enzyme function and mechanisms of drug resistance in addition to being helpful in the design of RT inhibitors. Despite hundreds of attempts, it was not possible to obtain the structure of a complex of HIV-1 RT with TMC278, a nonnucleoside RT inhibitor (NNRTI) in advanced clinical trials. A systematic and iterative protein crystal engineering approach was developed to optimize RT for obtaining crystals in complexes with TMC278 and other NNRTIs that diffract X-rays to 1.8 A resolution. Another form of engineered RT was optimized to produce a high-resolution apo-RT crystal form, reported here at 1.85 A resolution, with a distinct RT conformation. Engineered RTs were mutagenized using a new, flexible and cost effective method called methylated overlap-extension ligation independent cloning. Our analysis suggests that reducing the solvent content, increasing lattice contacts, and stabilizing the internal low-energy conformations of RT are critical for the growth of crystals that diffract to high resolution. The new RTs enable rapid crystallization and yield high-resolution structures that are useful in designing/developing new anti-AIDS drugs.},

The method has been applied to three helical peptides: a short helix shows sharp features of a two-state folder, while a longer helix and a three-helix bundle exhibit downhill and two-state transitions, respectively.

	abstract = {Thermodynamic integration is a widely used method to calculate and analyze the effect of a chemical modification on the free energy of a chemical or biochemical process, for example, the impact of an amino acid substitution on protein association. Numerical fluctuations can introduce large uncertainties, limiting the domain of application of the method. The parametric energy function describing the chemical modification in the thermodynamic integration, the “alchemical path”, determines the amplitudes of the fluctuations. In the present work, I propose a measure of the fluctuations in the thermodynamic integration and an approach to search for a parametric energy path minimizing that measure. The optimal path derived with this approach is very close to the theoretical minimum of the measure, but produces nonergodic sampling. Nevertheless, this path is used to guide the design of a practical and efficient path producing correct sampling. The convergence with this practical path is evaluated on test cases, and compares favorably with that of other methods such as power or polynomial path, soft-core van der Waals, and some other approaches presented in the literature.

	abstract = {It has recently been shown that the highly protected segments 24-34 (S2) and 83-93 (S8) of each of the two 99-mers of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease play an essential role in the folding of the monomers, giving rise to the so-called (postcritical) folding nucleus ((FN) minimum condensation unit ensuring folding) when they dock. This scenario received further support from model calculations that demonstrated that the peptide p-S8, displaying an amino acid sequence identical to the corresponding (83-93) segment of the monomer, can be used to interfere with the formation of the FN and eventually to inhibit folding by docking the fragment 24-34. Experiments in vitro and in cells infected with ex vivo wild-type and multiresistant HIV isolates confirm that the inhibition power of p-S8 is robust. On the other hand, there is no direct evidence demonstrating the validity of the proposed mechanism of inhibition associated with p-S8. To shed light on this question and to provide the basis for the design of a molecule mimetic to p-S8, to be used as lead of an eventual drug against AIDS, we study, in this paper, with the help of all-atom simulations in explicit solvent and the novel method of metadynamics combined with parallel tempering: a), the free energy and the equilibrium structure of each of the peptides p-S2 and p-S8; b), the details of the docking mechanism of the two peptides and the free energy associated with this process. Whereas p-S8 is found to be well structured, p-S2 is rather flexible, wrapping itself around p-S8 to give rise to the FN, which is stabilized by three particular hydrogen bonds.},

Three model systems are investigated: (a) two one-dimensional harmonic oscillators interacting with a third particle that represents the solvent, (b) the aqueous solvation of two diatomic molecules, and (c) the aqueous solvation of ethane and methanol. In each case, the computations are carried out with both a single topology and a dual topology methodology. A comparison of free energy components of the single and double free energy differences obtained in the calculations makes it possible to identify the three contributions that the theoretical analysis showed were involved, i.e., vibrational, pmf-type, and Jacobian factor terms.The verification of the theoretical analysis by illustrative examples provides the basis for addressing the question of whether the so-called self-terms can make significant contributions to double free energy differences. This is accomplished by identifying the effect of coupling of the three contributions from bonded energy terms on a double free energy difference. For the model systems studied, coupling and, hence, self-terms are found to be of little importance. The analysis resolves the ambiguities concerning this issue in the literature.},

	abstract = {The role of the bonded (bond stretching and bond angle) force-field terms in free energy simulations is examined. It is shown that the proper treatment of such terms depends on the choice of the free energy methodology (single or dual topology). Furthermore, while there are no problems in describing changes in bonded terms, care has to be used in creating or destroying them in a molecular dynamics simulation. An approach that avoids the singularity caused by a bond with a zero force constant is outlined. Changes in bond stretching or bond angle terms are shown to give rise to vibrational, Jacobian factor, and potential-of-mean-force-type (pmf) contributions. The meaning of bond stretching and bond angle bending free energy components obtained in single and dual topology simulations and their connection to these three contributions is investigated. Due to the different end states used in single and dual topology simulations, the pmf contribution is projected on different free energy components. In certain dual topology methods, vibrational and Jacobian factor contributions are not included in the free energy difference. Therefore, single free energy differences (e.g., the free energy difference between two molecules in the gas phase and in solution) often cannot be compared directly between single and dual topology methods. However, identical double free energy differences (e.g., free energy differences of solvation) are obtained in all cases. The present analysis emphasizes the importance of the details of the simulation methodology in interpreting the results for bonded terms and reconciles apparently contradictory findings in the literature.},

	abstract = {The computation of absolute binding affinities by molecular dynamics (MD) based free energy simulations is analyzed, and an exact method to carry out such a computation is presented. The key to obtaining converged results is the introduction of suitable, auxiliary restraints to prevent the ligand from leaving the binding site when the native ligandreceptor interactions are turned off alchemically. We describe a versatile set of restraints that (i) can be used in MD simulations, that (ii) restricts both the position and the orientation of the ligand, and that (iii) is defined relative to the receptor rather than relative to a fixed point in space. The free energy cost, DeltaAr, for this set of restraints can be evaluated analytically. Although the techniques were originally developed for the gas phase, the resulting expression is exact, since all contributions from solutesolvent interactions cancel from the final result. The value of DeltaAr depends only on the equilibrium values and force constants of the chosen harmonic restraint terms and, therefore, can be easily calculated. The standard state dependence of binding free energies is also investigated, and it is shown that the present approach takes this into account correctly. The analytical expression for DeltaAr is verified numerically by calculations on the complex formed by benzene with the L99A mutant of T4 lysozyme. The overall approach is illustrated by a complete binding free energy calculation for a complex based on a simplified model for tyrosine bound to tyrosyl-tRNA-synthetase. The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed set of restraints and confirm that the calculated binding free energy is independent of the details of the restraints. Comparisons are made with earlier formulations for the calculation of binding free energies, and certain limitations of that work are described. The relationship between DeltaAr and the loss of translational and rotational entropy during a binding process is analyzed.},

Second, the FFS algorithm is extended to obtain rate constants of partial transitions involving intermediate states from a single simulation; this is denoted “multiple state” FFS. For the FFS-US method, a FFS algorithm (preoptimized for order parameter and staging) is used to take advantage of its zero potential bias of phase-space sampling to gather histogram data with which to jump start the US and get the equilibrium distributions. In this way, kinetic data (like the rate constants and the transition path ensemble) and the underlying free-energy landscape (or probability distribution) of the system are obtained efficiently and concurrently. The applicability of these techniques is illustrated by studying several test systems, including two that involve potential energy surfaces having multiple metastable states and transition pathways, representative of complex kinetic behavior.},

As many such enzymes are found in multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, novel β-lactamase inhibitors are urgently needed. Five unique 6-alkylidene-2′-substituted penicillanic acid sulfones (1−5) were synthesized and tested against OXA-24, a clinically important β-lactamase that inactivates carbapenems and is found in A. baumannii. Based upon the roles Tyr112 and Met223 play in the OXA-24 β-lactamase, we also engineered two variants (Tyr112Ala and Tyr112Ala,Met223Ala) to test the hypothesis that the hydrophobic tunnel formed by these residues influences inhibitor recognition. IC50 values against OXA-24 and two OXA-24 β-lactamase variants ranged from 10 ± 1 (4 vs WT) to 338 ± 20 nM (5 vs Tyr112Ala, Met223Ala). Compound 4 possessed the lowest Ki (500 ± 80 nM vs WT), and 1 possessed the highest inactivation efficiency (kinact/Ki = 0.21 ± 0.02 μM−1 s−1). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed a single covalent adduct, suggesting the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. X-ray structures of OXA-24 complexed to four inhibitors (2.0−2.6 {\textbackslash}AA) reveal the formation of stable bicyclic aromatic intermediates with their carbonyl oxygen in the oxyanion hole. These data provide the first structural evidence that 6-alkylidene-2′-substituted penicillin sulfones are effective mechanism-based inactivators of class D β-lactamases. Their unique chemistry makes them developmental candidates. Mechanisms for class D hydrolysis and inhibition are discussed, and a pathway for the evolution of the BlaR1 sensor of Staphylococcus aureus to the class D β-lactamases is proposed.},

The recent boom of NNRTIs is mainly due to their antiviral potency, high specificity and low toxicity. The rapid emergence of drug-resistant HIV-1 strains induced by the first generation drugs is a disadvantage bypassed, in part, by the broad spectrum second generation NNRTIs.

	abstract = {The evolution of antiretroviral drug resistance is a major problem in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection. Drug therapy failure is associated with accumulation of drug resistance mutations and results in the development of drug resistance. Drugs targeted against reverse transcriptase (RT) as well as drug-resistant RT have been shown to increase HIV-1 mutation frequencies. Furthermore, combinations of drug and drug-resistant RT can increase virus mutation frequencies in a multiplicative manner. The evolution of drug resistance also alters virus fitness. The correlation of increased HIV-1 mutation rates with the evolution of antiretroviral drug resistance indicates that drug failure could increase the likelihood of further resistance evolving from subsequent drug regimens. These observations parallel studies from microbial systems that provide evidence for a correlation between drug resistance development and increased pathogen mutation rates. Although increased mutant frequencies may be detrimental to effective therapy, the lethal mutagenesis of the HIV-1 genome may provide a new means for antiretroviral therapy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

In this work molecular dynamics (MD) methods were used to explain which structural aspects are determining for thermoresponsivity and how water properties in the hydrogel are influenced. Two topologically different models of the junction domain in the hydrogel at the experimental hydration degree were studied at 293 and 323 K, below and above the transition temperature. MD simulations of the corresponding oligomers of poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) were also performed for a comparison. Simulation results provided an atomic detailed description of the temperature induced modifications in the microgel network and of water dynamics, in agreement with available experimental findings.},

The structures reveal inhibitor binding is exclusively hydrophobic in nature and the shape of the inhibitor-bound NNRTI binding pocket is unique among other reported inhibitor−RT crystal structures. Primarily, ADAMs 3 and 4 protrude from a large gap in the back side of the binding pocket, placing portions of the inhibitors unusually close to the polymerase active site and allowing 3 to form a weak hydrogen bond with Lys223. The lack of additional stabilizing interactions, beyond the observed hydrophobic surface contacts, between 4 and RT is quite perplexing given the extreme potency of the compound (IC50 ≤ 1 nM). ADAM 4 was designed to be hydrolytically stable in blood plasma, and an investigation of its hydrolysis in rat plasma demonstrated it has a significantly prolonged half-life in comparison to ADAM lead compounds 1 and 2.},

	abstract = {Nanostructured free-standing films were obtained by polymerisation of lyotropic liquid crystal phases based on the monomer 3,4,5-tris(11′-acryloyloxyundecyloxy)benzoate. The structure of these films was investigated by X-ray diffraction. No change of the lattice due to the polymerisation procedure was observed. The low water content (below 10 wt.-\%) of the liquid crystals in combination with the observed hexagonal lattice reveal that a reversed hexagonal structure (H2 phase) is present. Different types of films were investigated, obtained by varying the preparation conditions of the used lyotropic liquid crystals, such as water content, type of metal-counterion and length of the monomer. The lattice constant was found to be independent of the water content. It seems that at low water content of 8 wt.-\% the lyotropic structure is still fully hydrated. This unusual behaviour is related to the tapered structure of the monomer which is composed of by a small headgroup and three extended tails for each headgroup. The lattice constant can be changed by using differently charged metal-counterions which are associated with the headgroup, as well as by varying the length of the tails on the monomer. Low resolution electron density maps of the hexagonal lattice give deeper insight in the arrangement of the monomers within the polymerised structure.},

The SEDE model (Steric, Electric and Dielectric Exclusion model) can be used to describe transport through pores of cylindrical or slit geometry. The coupling between the various mechanisms involved in the retention phenomenon is pointed out and discussed. The volume charge density of a NF polyamide membrane is determined from tangential streaming potential measurements. The SEDE model is then used to assess the rejection rate of the membrane, the dielectric constant of the solution filling pores being the single adjustable parameter of the model. It is clearly shown that the dielectric exclusion cannot be neglected in the analysis of the filtration properties of NF membranes. Indeed, the classical steric/electric exclusion theory is found to be unable to describe experimental rejection rates of the polyamide membrane under consideration.},

	abstract = {Wide-angle x-ray scattering (WAXS) experiments of biomolecules in solution have become increasingly popular because of technical advances in light sources and detectors. However, the structural interpretation of WAXS profiles is problematic, partly because accurate calculations of WAXS profiles from structural models have remained challenging. In this work, we present the calculation of WAXS profiles from explicit-solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of five different proteins. Using only a single fitting parameter that accounts for experimental uncertainties because of the buffer subtraction and dark currents, we find excellent agreement to experimental profiles both at small and wide angles. Because explicit solvation eliminates free parameters associated with the solvation layer or the excluded solvent, which would require fitting to experimental data, we minimize the risk of overfitting. We further find that the influence from water models and protein force fields on calculated profiles are insignificant up to q≈15nm−1. Using a series of simulations that allow increasing flexibility of the proteins, we show that incorporating thermal fluctuations into the calculations significantly improves agreement with experimental data, demonstrating the importance of protein dynamics in the interpretation of WAXS profiles. In addition, free MD simulations up to one microsecond suggest that the calculated profiles are highly sensitive with respect to minor conformational rearrangements of proteins, such as an increased flexibility of a loop or an increase of the radius of gyration by {\textless} 1\%. The present study suggests that quantitative comparison between MD simulations and experimental WAXS profiles emerges as an accurate tool to validate solution ensembles of biomolecules.},

Of these derivatives, only the l-alanine derivative (1) was found to form the HII phase, using N,N-dimethylformamide as the hydrophilic solvent. To our knowledge, this is one of the rare examples (if not the only example) of a Br?nsted acidic amphiphile capable of forming a high-curvature LLC phase. Monomer 1 was also found to be able to direct the formation of the other amide-containing acidic derivatives into the HII phase when blended together. IR analysis revealed that intermolecular amide H-bonding near the headgroup plays a major role in the LLC assembly and structure-directing behavior of these systems.},

Side-chain liquid crystalline polyethers (SCLCPs), based on poly(epichlorohydrin) (PECH) and poly(epichlorohydrin-co-ethylene oxide) (P(ECH-co-EO)), dendronized with potassium 3,4,5-tris[4-(n-dodecan-1-yloxy)benzyloxy]benzoate were specially designed for this purpose. When cast as membranes, these tailored polymers self-assembled into columns, driven by exo-recognition. They thus mimic the highly specific supramolecular organization observed in nature and present the first biomimetic material for proton transport out of which stable, oriented and self-sustained membranes could be prepared. As revealed by combined X-ray diffraction, Atomic Force Microscopy and Transmission Electron Microscopy, polymeric column formation was obtained in the cast membranes following a thermally induced homeotropical orientation. Two unique and highly desired properties were found in the resulting membranes. While conventional proton conducting membranes exploit an “acidic group-based” transport mechanism, the current columns pillaring across the membranes formed ionic paths, giving rise to a remarkable size-dependent antiport transport mechanism. It resulted in conductivity values in the range of 10−2–10−3 S/cm, comparable to current state-of-the-art Nafion membranes, but, most importantly, with a complete independency from relative humidity. Reported membranes thus open excellent opportunities for further fine-tuning of their properties, wider exploitation of the exceptional transport mechanism, and final applications in fuel cells and related fields.},

Recently, coordination nanosheets (CONASHs) came into the world as new series of two-dimensional frameworks, which can show various functions based on metal complexes formed by numerous combinations of metal ions and ligands. This Feature Article provides an overview of recent progress in synthesizing CONASHs and in elucidating their intriguing electrical, sensing, and catalytic properties. We also review recent theoretical studies on the prediction of the unique electronic structures, magnetism, and catalytic ability of materials based on CONASHs.

	abstract = {A macromolecular nanopore inserted into a membrane may perturb the dynamic organization of the surrounding lipid bilayer. To better understand the nature of such perturbations, we have undertaken a systematic molecular dynamics simulation study of lipid bilayer structure and dynamics around three different classes of nanopore: a carbon nanotube, three related cyclic peptide nanotubes differing in the nature of their external surfaces, and a model of a ?-barrel nanopore protein. Periodic spatial distributions of several lipid properties as a function of distance from the nanopore were observed. This was especially clear for the carbon nanotube system, for which the density of lipids, the bilayer thickness, the projection of lipid head-to-tail vectors onto the membrane plane, and lipid lateral diffusion coefficients exhibited undulatory behavior as a function of the distance from the surface of the channel. Overall, the differences in lipid behavior as a function of the nanopore structure reveal local adaptation of the bilayer structure and dynamics to different embedded nanopore structures. Both the local structure and dynamic behavior of lipids around membrane-embedded nanopores are sensitive to the geometry and nature of the outer surface of the macromolecule/molecular assembly forming the pore.},

Polarized light microscopy (PLM) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) techniques have been employed for the characterization of LLC systems. Time-resolved fluorescence results reveal the retarded ESPT dynamics inside liquid crystalline systems compared to bulk water, and it follows the order HII {\textless} Ia3d {\textless} Pn3m {\textless} H2O. The slower solvation, hampered ?Grotthuss? proton transfer process, and most importantly, topological influence, of the LLC systems are believed to be mainly responsible for the slower and different extent of ESPT dynamics. Interestingly, recombination dynamics is found to be faster with respect to bulk water and it follows the order H2O {\textless} Pn3m {\textless} Ia3d {\textless} HII. Faster recombination dynamics arises due to lower dielectric constant and different channel diameters of these LLC systems. However, the dissociation dynamics is found to be slower than bulk water and it follows the order HII {\textless} Ia3d {\textless} Pn3m {\textless} H2O. Differences in critical packing parameter of LLC systems are believed to be the governing factors for the slower dissociation dynamics in these liquid crystalline systems.},

Here, we describe the preparation of surface-adaptive, Triclosan-loaded micellar nanocarriers showing (1) enhanced biofilm penetration and accumulation, (2) electrostatic targeting at acidic pH toward negatively charged bacterial cell surfaces in a biofilm, and (3) antimicrobial release due to degradation of the micelle core by bacterial lipases. First, it was established that mixed-shell-polymeric-micelles (MSPM) consisting of a hydrophilic poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-shell and pH-responsive poly(?-amino ester) become positively charged at pH 5.0, while being negatively charged at physiological pH. This is opposite to single-shell-polymeric-micelles (SSPM) possessing only a PEG-shell and remaining negatively charged at pH 5.0. The stealth properties of the PEG-shell combined with its surface-adaptive charge allow MSPMs to penetrate and accumulate in staphylococcal biofilms, as demonstrated for fluorescent Nile red loaded micelles using confocal-laser-scanning-microscopy. SSPMs, not adapting a positive charge at pH 5.0, could not be demonstrated to penetrate and accumulate in a biofilm. Once micellar nanocarriers are bound to a staphylococcal cell surface, bacterial enzymes degrade the MSPM core to release its antimicrobial content and kill bacteria over the depth of a biofilm. This constitutes a highly effective pathway to control blood-accessible staphylococcal biofilms using antimicrobials, bypassing biofilm recalcitrance to antimicrobial penetration.},

	abstract = {The dynamic equilibrium model for a bulk nanobubble partly covered with hydrophobic material in water is theoretically and numerically studied. The gas diffusion into a bubble near the peripheral edge of the hydrophobic material on the bubble surface balances that out of the bubble from the other part of the uncovered bubble surface. In the present model, gas diffusion in quiescent liquid is assumed and there is no liquid flow. The total changes of energy and entropy are both zero as it is a kind of equilibrium state. The main origin of the dynamic equilibrium state is the gradient of chemical potential of gas near the peripheral edge of the hydrophobic material. It is caused by the permanent attractive potential of a hydrophobic material to gas molecules dissolved in liquid water as there is permanent repulsion of a hydrophobic material against liquid water. Thus, the gas supply will not terminate. It is numerically shown that stable nanobubble could be present when the fraction of surface coverage by hydrophobic material is from about 0.5 to 1. The stable size of a nanobubble changes with the liquid temperature as well as the degree of gas saturation of water. In slightly degassed water, not only a nanobubble but also a microbubble could be stable in mass balance when the fraction of surface coverage for a microbubble is on the order of 10?4 or less. For hydrophilic materials, however, a bubble could not be stable unless the fraction of the surface coverage is exactly 1. It is suggested that in many experiments of bulk nanobubbles there could be aggregates of nanobubbles.},

An ideal nanoporous membrane would consist of a thin film with physically continuous and vertically aligned nanopores and would display a narrow distribution of pore sizes. However, the current state of the art departs considerably from this ideal and is beset by intrinsic trade-offs between permeability and selectivity. We demonstrate an effective and scalable method to fabricate polymer films with ideal membrane morphologies consisting of submicron thickness films with physically continuous and vertically aligned 1 nm pores. The approach is based on soft confinement to control the orientation of a cross-linkable mesophase in which the pores are produced by self-assembly. The scalability, exceptional ease of fabrication, and potential to create a new class of nanofiltration membranes stand out as compelling aspects.},

Here we report facile, scalabe fabrication of polymer membranes with vertically (i.e., along the through-plane direction) aligned 1 nm pores by magnetic-field alignment and subsequent cross-linking of a liquid crystalline mesophase. We utilize a wedge-shaped amphiphilic species as the building block of a thermotropic columnar mesophase with 1 nm ionic nanochannels, and leverage the magnetic anisotropy of the amphiphile to control the alignment of these pores with a magnetic field. In situ X-ray scattering and subsequent optical microscopy reveal the formation of highly ordered nanostructured mesophases and cross-linked polymer films with orientational order parameters of ca. 0.95. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging provides direct visualization of long-range persistence of vertically aligned, hexagonally packed nanopores in unprecedented detail, demonstrating high-fidelity retention of structure and alignment after photo-cross-linking. Ionic conductivity measurements on the aligned membranes show a remarkable 85-fold enhancement of conductivity over nonaligned samples. These results provide a path to achieving the large area control of morphology and related enhancement of properties required for high-performance membranes and other applications.},

To model ternary mixtures of polar, nonpolar, and amphiphilic molecules, we develop a molecular thermodynamic theory for polydisperse water-in-oil (W/O) droplet-type microemulsions and reverse micelles based on global minimization of the Gibbs free energy of the system. The incorporation of size polydispersity into the theoretical formulation has a significant effect on the Gibbs free energy landscape and allows us to accurately predict micelle size distributions and micelle size variation with composition. Results are presented for two sample ionic surfactant/water/oil systems and compared with experimental data. By predicting the structural and compositional characteristics of w/o microemulsions, the molecular thermodynamic approach provides an important bridge between the modeling of ternary systems at the molecular and the macroscopic level.},

The sensitivity of this smart skin is remarkable, which can even perceive the perturbation of a honey bee. Meanwhile, benefiting from the triboelectric mechanism, extra power supply is unnecessary for this smart skin. Therefore, it solves the problems of batteries and connecting wires for smart skins.

At certain conditions the fluid inside and outside the nanoporous material can be viewed as a two-phase system, with an interface between them, which poses an excess resistance to matter flow. We show that there exist two kinds of phenomena which influence the interfacial resistance: hydrodynamic effects and thermodynamic effects, which are independent of each other. Here, we investigate the role of the thermodynamic effects in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and slit pores and compare the associated thermodynmic resistance with that due to hydrodynamic effects traditionally modeled by the established Sampson expression. Using CH4 and CO2 as model fluids, we show that the thermodynamic resistance is especially important for moderate to high pressures, at which the fluid within the CNT or slit pore is in the condensed state. Further, we show that at such pressures the thermodynamic resistance becomes comparable with the internal resistance to fluid transport at length scales typical of membranes used in fuel cells, and of importance in membrane-based separation, and nanofluidics in general.},

	abstract = {A critical assessment of previous theoretical descriptions of membrane nanofiltration shows that the good agreement with experimental data is due to the use of the ratio of effective membrane thickness to membrane porosity as an arbitrary fitting parameter. A more rigorous analysis shows that rejection is independent of membrane thickness.

A model allowing calculation of uncharged solute rejection on the basis of a single membrane parameter (pore radius) is developed. The theoretical description is based on a hydrodynamic model of hindered solute transport in pores. The dependence of solute chemical potential on pressure is included, although its effect is shown to be small. A variation of solvent viscosity with pore radius is also included. For pores of a single size, such variation has no effect on rejection, though it will become important for overall membrane rejection if a pore size distribution is included. The good agreement between this model and experimental data confirms that uncharged solute rejection in nanofiltration membranes may be well-described by such a continuum model.

A two-parameter model (pore radius and membrane charge) for electrolyte rejection has been developed that includes dielectric exclusion in the form of an energy barrier to ion partitioning into the pores. Reassessment of the pore dielectric constant using NaCl rejection at the isoelectric point of a Desal-DK membrane resulted in significantly better agreement with experimental rejection data than use of the high frequency solvent dielectric constant for an oriented layer of water molecules at the pore walls. The predicted values of effective membrane charge density were not only significantly reduced in magnitude, and hence more realistic, than those from previous models, but their variation with concentration for divalent salts was in better agreement with physical models of ion adsorption.

The theoretical descriptions of the present paper are developed more rigorously than those previously published. Their overall agreement with experimental data is good and the resulting membrane parameters are likely to be more closely related to physical membrane properties than those obtained from previous models. The descriptions are useful for membrane process assessment and prediction. They also provide a sound basis for further developments.},

	abstract = {Electrodialysis is a promising process to treat saline water containing organic solute. The desalination performances are fixed by the transfer of salts and organic solutes. On the contrary to the transfer of salts, few results were reported regarding that of organic compounds. This is the objective of this work to investigate the transfer of neutral organic solutes (acetic acid, phenol, glucose) through ion-exchange membranes, focusing on the influence of the salt (NaCl, MgCl2, Na2SO4). Results show that the water transfer due to electroosmosis depends on the salt composition following the ion hydration. Two contributions, diffusion and convection, are pointed out for the transfer of organic solutes. Both are important and mainly fixed by steric effect. Concerning the influence of the ion hydration, reverse trends are found for both contributions. Decreasing diffusion flux is observed for increasing membrane counter-ion hydration showing the influence of the membrane structural properties. Increasing convection flux is observed for increasing ion hydration showing the influence of the solute hydration.},

	abstract = {Nanoporous materials are important in industrial separation, but their application is subject to strong interfacial barriers to the entry and transport of fluids. At certain conditions the fluid inside and outside the nanoporous material can be viewed as a two-phase system, with an interface between them, which poses an excess resistance to matter flow. We show that there exist two kinds of phenomena which influence the interfacial resistance: hydrodynamic effects and thermodynamic effects, which are independent of each other. Here, we investigate the role of the thermodynamic effects in carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and slit pores and compare the associated thermodynmic resistance with that due to hydrodynamic effects traditionally modeled by the established Sampson expression. Using CH4 and CO2 as model fluids, we show that the thermodynamic resistance is especially important for moderate to high pressures, at which the fluid within the CNT or slit pore is in the condensed state. Further, we show that at such pressures the thermodynamic resistance becomes comparable with the internal resistance to fluid transport at length scales typical of membranes used in fuel cells, and of importance in membrane-based separation, and nanofluidics in general.},

In this study, we report the generation of lipid nanoparticle libraries with information regarding mesophase and lattice parameter, which can aid the selection of formulation for a particular end-use application. In this study we elucidate the phase composition parameters that influence the internal structure of lipid nanoparticles produced from monoolein, monopalmitolein and phytantriol incorporating a variety of saturated fatty acids (FA) with different chain lengths at varying concentrations and temperatures. The material libraries were established using high throughput formulation and screening techniques, including synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering. The results demonstrate the rich polymorphism of lipid nanoparticles with nonlamellar mesophases in the presence of saturated FAs. The inclusion of saturated FAs within the lipid nanoparticles promotes a gradual phase transition at all temperatures studied toward structures with higher negative surface curvatures (e.g., from inverse bicontinuous cubic phase to hexagonal phase and then emulsified microemulsion). The three partial phase diagrams produced are discussed in terms of the influence of FA chain length and concentration on nanoparticle internal mesophase structure and lattice parameters. The study also highlights a compositionally dependent coexistence of multiple mesophases, which may indicate the presence of multicompartment nanoparticles containing cubic/cubic and cubic/hexagonal mesophases.},

Their potential to enhance viscoelasticity by anisotropic micellar growth upon salt addition was compared in terms of (i) the influence of the headgroup structure, and (ii) the influence of surfactant counterion type. Employing proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR), we focused on the molecular conformation of surfactant monomers in the core and polar shell regions of the micelles and their interactions with increasing concentration of NaSal. The viscoelastic response was investigated by rotational and oscillatory rheology. We show that micellar growth rates can be tuned by varying the flexibility and size of the surfactant headgroup as well as the dissociation degree of the surfactant counterion, which directly influences the strength of headgroup?counterion pairing. As a consequence, the morphological transitions depend directly on charge neutralization by electrostatic screening. For example, the amount of salt necessary to start the rodlike-to-wormlike micelle growth depends directly on the number of dissociated counterions in the polar shell.},

	abstract = {Separation of gases and liquids mixtures into their constituents is crucial for many industrial processes. Accordingly, development of high performance membranes with enhanced permeability, salt rejections and low energy consumption has drawn many researchers’ attentions. High potential candidates are Mixed-Matrix Membranes (MMMs) combining the benefits of both polymer and carbon nano-tubes (CNTs) for high processability, selectivity and throughput. However, there are still challenging issues, such as, poor miscibility between the polymeric phase and the carbon nano-tubes and the ensuing phase separation problems. In this study, by combining experiments and multiscale modeling approaches (i.e., molecular dynamics and mesoscale simulation), we focus on (1) the functionalization of multi walled CNTs (MWCNTs) to improve the compatibility between MWCNTs and a co-polyimide (P84) and to obtain homogeneous dispersion without phase separation problems and on (2) the mechanism and validation of homogeneous dispersion of MWCNTs through P84. First, we perform molecular dynamics (MD) simulation to calculate the solubility parameters of various CNTs, pristine and functionalized with the polar groups –OH and –NH2, and polymer matrix used for CNT/polymer composite membrane fabrication. After then, mesoscale simulations are executed to understand the macroscopic CNT dispersion through the polymer matrix. Finally, modeling results are validated by experimental data obtained by the preparation of composite P84 membranes containing MWCNTs pristine or functionalized. The MWCNTs functionalization is carried out by oxidation or amination procedure in order to introduce oxygenated and amine species, respectively. A good agreement between theoretical calculation and experimental results is achieved confirming the necessity to functionalize the MWCNTs with polar groups in order to obtain a good dispersion in the hydrophilic P84 matrix and the prediction of an optimum range of functional groups in order to obtain well dispersed MMM.},

	abstract = {Diffusion in one dimensional rugged energy landscape (REL) is predicted to be pathologically different (from any higher dimension) with a much larger chance of encountering broken ergodicity [D. L. Stein and C. M. Newman, AIP Conf. Proc. 1479, 620 (2012)]. However, no quantitative study of this difference has been reported, despite the prevalence of multidimensional physical models in the literature (like a high dimensional funnel guiding protein folding/unfolding). Paradoxically, some theoretical studies of these phenomena still employ a one dimensional diffusion description for analytical tractability. We explore the dimensionality dependent diffusion on REL by carrying out an effective medium approximation based analytical calculations and compare them with the available computer simulation results. We find that at an intermediate level of ruggedness (assumed to have a Gaussian distribution), where diffusion is well-defined, the value of the effective diffusion coefficient depends on dimensionality and changes (increases) by several factors (∼5-10) in going from 1d to 2d. In contrast, the changes in subsequent transitions (like 2d to 3d and 3d to 4d and so on) are far more modest, of the order of 10-20\% only. When ruggedness is given by random traps with an exponential distribution of barrier heights, the mean square displacement (MSD) is sub-diffusive (a well-known result), but the growth of MSD is described by different exponents in one and higher dimensions. The reason for such strong ruggedness induced retardation in the case of one dimensional REL is discussed. We also discuss the special limiting case of infinite dimension (d = ∞) where the effective medium approximation becomes exact and where theoretical results become simple. We discuss, for the first time, the role of spatial correlation in the landscape on diffusion of a random walker.},

Thousands of MOFs have been reported to date. However, membrane performance of only a small number of MOFs has been experimentally reported since fabrication of thin-film MOF membranes is challenging. In this study, we used atomically-detailed simulations to assess membrane-based CH4/H2 separation performances of 172 different MOF structures. Adsorption selectivity, diffusion selectivity, membrane selectivity and gas permeability of MOFs were calculated using atomically-detailed simulations to identify the most promising membrane materials. Our results show that a significant number of MOF membranes exhibits high CH4 selectivity over H2 and a small number of MOF membranes exhibits mediocre H2 selectivity over CH4. Gas permeabilities and selectivities of MOF membranes were compared with traditional membranes such as polymers and zeolites. Several MOFs were identified to exceed the upper bound established for polymeric membranes and many MOF membranes showed higher gas permeabilities and selectivities than zeolites LTA, ITQ-29 and MFI. We also carried out flexible molecular dynamics simulations to examine the effect of MOF's flexibility on the predicted membrane performance. Considering flexibility of the framework made a negligible effect on the gas permeability and selectivity of the material having large pores whereas more pronounced changes were seen in gas permeabilities of the material having narrow pores. The results of this computational study will be helpful to guide the experiments to the most promising MOF membranes for CH4/H2 separations.},

This phenomenon is important for a wide range of applications, from chemomechanical sensors to methane recovery from geological formations. The strain of the solid is driven by the change of the surface stress due to adsorption. Using ab initio molecular dynamics, we calculate the surface stresses for the dry α-quartz surfaces, and investigate how these stresses change when the surfaces are exposed to water. We find that the nonhydroxylated surface shows small and approximately isotropic changes in stress, while the hydroxylated surface, which interacts more strongly with the polar water molecules, shows larger and qualitatively anisotropic (opposite sign in xx and yy) surface stress changes. All of these changes are several times larger than the surface tension of water itself. The anisotropy and possibility of positive surface stress change can explain experimentally observed surface area contraction due to adsorption.},

In particular, a series of isostructural MOFs with coordinately unsaturated metal centers, namely, CPO-27-M or M-MOF-74 (M = Mg, Zn, Mn, Fe, Ni, Co, Cu), have shown exceptional adsorption capacity and selectivity compared to those of classical MOFs that contain only fully coordinated metal sites. Although it is widely accepted that the interaction between guest molecules and exposed metal centers is responsible for good selectivity and large maximum uptake, the investigation of such guest–metal interaction is very challenging because adsorbed molecules are usually disordered in the pores and undergo rapid thermal motions. 2H solid-state NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy is one of the most extensively used techniques for capturing guest dynamics in porous materials. In this work, variable-temperature 2H wide-line SSNMR experiments were performed on CPO-27-M (M = Mg, Zn) loaded with four prototypical guest molecules: D2O, CD3CN, acetone-d6, and C6D6. The results indicate that different guest molecules possess distinct dynamic behaviors inside the channel of CPO-27-M. For a given guest molecule, its dynamic behavior also depends on the nature of the metal centers. The binding strength of guest molecules is discussed on the basis of the 2H SSNMR data.},

The phase separation process simulated by this methodology could be close to a real membrane formation process by adopting a linear cooling algorithm based on the macroscopic model results and providing much larger scales. The simulation results indicated that the temperature gradient in the polymer solution resulted from the heat transfer at the polymer solution-coagulation bath interface had a significant influence on the phase separation process, thereby different parts in the polymer solution possessed different cooling rates and coarsen time, which resulted in a microporous membrane with anisotropic structure. Secondly, as the polymer concentration increased, the system became much denser and the phase separation rate got lower due to a decline in the flexibility of the system. The results proved that a further deep understanding could be obtained by this methodology.},

We study this process by extensive molecular dynamics simulations of both atomistic and coarse-grained models. It is found that the rate of intramolecular cross-linking is close to quadratic in the number of unlinked cross-linkers, namely BCB monomeric units, while the completeness of the reaction is affected by the steric hindrance of the cross-linked polymer. An equation incorporating both of these processes yields a good agreement with simulation data. A rigidity effect is identified when the cross-linkers account for more than about 60\% of a precursor BCB/styrene copolymer. Above this threshold, the radii of gyration of intramolecularly cross-linked BCB/styrene copolymers show little dependence on their cross-linker concentrations, and a relatively large number of BCB monomeric units are left unreacted in each polymer. In addition, a temperature series study is performed on the intramolecular cross-linking of freely jointed chain (FJC) samples. We introduce the chemical distance density to provide a relation between the topology of cross-linking and the structure of a cross-linked polymer. A power law relation is found between the radius of gyration of the polymer and the chemical distance density, in both FJC samples and BCB/styrene copolymers.},

Thermodynamic and mechanical properties were calculated as a function of the cross-link density. A new relative reactivity volume (RRV) algorithm was developed to generate the cross-linking network by incorporating the correct regioselectivity (head-to-tail chain propagation) and monomer reactivity ratios. This is the first application of reactivity ratios for free radical addition polymerization in MD simulations. Prior cross-linking simulations were performed on step-growth epoxy resin curing. Vinyl esters studied here cure by free radical addition copolymerization. Cross-linked networks with double bond conversions up to 98\% were achieved. Volume shrinkage, glass transition temperatures, and tensile elastic constants were calculated. Predicted Young’s moduli were compared with experimental data. This RRV method can generate other thermoset and thermoplastic systems containing different monomers, and provide an approach for handling simultaneous irreversible reactions in MD simulations.},

	abstract = {Throughout the world, water scarcity is being recognised as a present or future threat to human activity and as a consequence, a definite trend to develop alternative water resources such as desalination can be observed. The most commonly used desalination technologies are reverse osmosis (RO) and thermal processes such as multi-stage flash (MSF) and multi-effect distillation (MED). In Europe, reverse osmosis, due to its lower energy consumption has gained much wider acceptance than its thermal alternatives. This review summarises the current state-of-the art of reverse osmosis desalination, dealing not only with the reverse osmosis stage, but with the entire process from raw water intake to post treatment of product water. The discussion of process fundamentals, membranes and membrane modules and of current and future developments in membrane technology is accompanied by an analysis of operational issues as fouling and scaling and of measures for their prevention such as adequate cleaning procedures and antiscalant use. Special focus is placed on pre-treatment of raw water and post-treatment of brine as well as of product water to meet drinking and irrigation water standards, including evaluation of current boron removal options. Energy requirements of reverse osmosis plants as well as currently applied energy recovery systems for reduction of energy consumption are described and cost and cost structure of reverse osmosis desalination are outlined. Finally, current practices of waste management and disposal as well as new trends such as the use of hybrid plants, i.e. combining reverse osmosis with thermal processes and/or power generation are addressed.},

	abstract = {The paper presents and compares the marine and atmospheric discharges of typical large MSF and RO plants. Distillation plants require an inlet seawater flow around 8 to 10 times the fresh water production rate, for cooling and feed make-up. The discharge is raised in salinity and in temperature, due to heat rejection from the process. A seawater RO plant generally requires a lower feedwater flow rate of around 2.5 to 3 times the production. Salinity of the discharge is correspondingly greater than in distillation, but temperature rise is small. Chemical discharges are compared for the different processes. A comparison is made of atmospheric emissions from generating the power to drive RO process pumps and the emissions resulting from generation of steam and auxiliary power for distillation (in dual purpose desalination/power plants). The factors affecting site selection and requirements for seawater intakes and outfalls are briefly discussed, with examples. The land area needed for a desalination plant is compared with the catchment and reservoir areas needed for a typical surface water collection scheme to illustrate the much lower impact of desalination on land resources. Factors such as noise and aesthetics are also briefly discussed.},

Since the removal of these compounds in water and wastewater treatment applications is of great importance where a high product water quality is desired, an understanding of the factors affecting the permeation of solutes in high-pressure membrane systems is needed. In this paper, findings of a comprehensive literature review are reported, targeting membrane rejection mechanisms and factors affecting rejection. The following key solute parameters were identified to primarily affect solute rejection: molecular weight (MW), molecular size (length and width), acid disassociation constant (pKa), hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity (log Kow), and diffusion coefficient (Dp). Key membrane properties affecting rejection that were identified include molecular weight cut-off, pore size, surface charge (measured as zeta potential), hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity (measured as contact angle), and surface morphology (measured as roughness). In addition, feed water composition, such as pH, ionic strength, hardness, and the presence of organic matter, was also identified as having an influence on solute rejection. From the knowledge gained during the literature review, a rejection diagram was proposed, which qualitatively allows prediction of solute rejection if certain solute and membrane properties are known.},

	abstract = {In pressure-driven membrane processes (reverse osmosis, nanofiltration, ultrafiltration, and microfiltration) a pressure exerted on the solution at one side of the membrane serves as a driving force to separate it into a permeate and a retentate. The permeate is usually pure water, whereas the retentate is a concentrated solution that must be disposed of or treated by other methods. Membranes may be polymeric, organo-mineral, ceramic, or metallic, and filtration techniques differ in pore size, from dense (no pores) to porous membranes. Depending on the type of technique, salts, small organic molecules, macromolecules, or particles can be retained, and the applied pressure will differ. This paper reviews the principles behind the different techniques, the types of membranes used, rejection mechanisms, and process modeling. Applications of pressure-driven membrane processes are also considered, including reverse osmosis and nanofiltration for the treatment of wastewater from landfills and composting plants, nanofiltration in the textile industry, and ultrafiltration and microfiltration in drinking water production and wastewater treatment. Lastly, the paper discusses recent developments, including techniques to prevent membrane fouling by modifications affecting surface roughness or hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, or by cleaning the membranes, and methods for treating or disposing of the retentate.},

	abstract = {, The hydration of the alkali metal ions in aqueous solution
has been studied by large angle X-ray scattering (LAXS) and double
difference infrared spectroscopy (DDIR). The structures of the dimethyl
sulfoxide solvated alkali metal ions in solution have been determined
to support the studies in aqueous solution. The results of the LAXS
and DDIR measurements show that the sodium, potassium, rubidium and
cesium ions all are weakly hydrated with only a single shell of water
molecules. The smaller lithium ion is more strongly hydrated, most
probably with a second hydration shell present. The influence of the
rubidium and cesium ions on the water structure was found to be very
weak, and it was not possible to quantify this effect in a reliable
way due to insufficient separation of the O–D stretching bands
of partially deuterated water bound to these metal ions and the O–D
stretching bands of the bulk water. Aqueous solutions of sodium, potassium
and cesium iodide and cesium and lithium hydroxide have been studied
by LAXS and M–O bond distances have been determined fairly
accurately except for lithium. However, the number of water molecules
binding to the alkali metal ions is very difficult to determine from
the LAXS measurements as the number of distances and the temperature
factor are strongly correlated. A thorough analysis of M–O
bond distances in solid alkali metal compounds with ligands binding
through oxygen has been made from available structure databases. There
is relatively strong correlation between M–O bond distances
and coordination numbers also for the alkali metal ions even though
the M–O interactions are weak and the number of complexes of
potassium, rubidium and cesium with well-defined coordination geometry
is very small. The mean M–O bond distance in the hydrated sodium,
potassium, rubidium and cesium ions in aqueous solution have been
determined to be 2.43(2), 2.81(1), 2.98(1) and 3.07(1) Å, which
corresponds to six-, seven-, eight- and eight-coordination. These
coordination numbers are supported by the linear relationship of the
hydration enthalpies and the M–O bond distances. This correlation
indicates that the hydrated lithium ion is four-coordinate in aqueous
solution. New ionic radii are proposed for four- and six-coordinate
lithium(I), 0.60 and 0.79 Å, respectively, as well as for five-
and six-coordinate sodium(I), 1.02 and 1.07 Å, respectively.
The ionic radii for six- and seven-coordinate K+, 1.38
and 1.46 Å, respectively, and eight-coordinate Rb+ and Cs+, 1.64 and 1.73 Å, respectively, are confirmed
from previous studies. The M–O bond distances in dimethyl sulfoxide
solvated sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium ions in solution are
very similar to those observed in aqueous solution., The hydration of alkali metal ions has been studied by large angle
X-ray scattering, LAXS, and double difference infrared spectroscopy.
The obtained M−O bond distances from LAXS have been compared
to relevant crystal structures, conclusions about hydration numbers
in aqueous solution have been made, and new ionic radii have been
proposed. Hydration numbers of six, seven, eight and eight are proposed
for the sodium, potassium, rubidium and cesium ions in aqueous solution.},

	abstract = {Reverse osmosis membrane technology has developed over the past 40 years to a 44\% share in world desalting production capacity, and an 80\% share in the total number of desalination plants installed worldwide. The use of membrane desalination has increased as materials have improved and costs have decreased. Today, reverse osmosis membranes are the leading technology for new desalination installations, and they are applied to a variety of salt water resources using tailored pretreatment and membrane system design. Two distinct branches of reverse osmosis desalination have emerged: seawater reverse osmosis and brackish water reverse osmosis. Differences between the two water sources, including foulants, salinity, waste brine (concentrate) disposal options, and plant location, have created significant differences in process development, implementation, and key technical problems. Pretreatment options are similar for both types of reverse osmosis and depend on the specific components of the water source. Both brackish water and seawater reverse osmosis (RO) will continue to be used worldwide; new technology in energy recovery and renewable energy, as well as innovative plant design, will allow greater use of desalination for inland and rural communities, while providing more affordable water for large coastal cities. A wide variety of research and general information on RO desalination is available; however, a direct comparison of seawater and brackish water RO systems is necessary to highlight similarities and differences in process development. This article brings to light key parameters of an RO process and process modifications due to feed water characteristics.},

	abstract = {Reverse osmosis (RO) is currently the most important desalination technology and it is experiencing significant growth. The objective of this paper is to review the historical and current development of RO membrane materials which are the key determinants of separation performance and water productivity, and hence to define performance targets for those who are developing new RO membrane materials. The chemistry, synthesis mechanism(s) and desalination performance of various RO membranes are discussed from the point of view of membrane materials science. The review starts with the first generation of asymmetric polymeric membranes and finishes with current proposals for nano-structured membrane materials. The paper provides an overview of RO performance in relation to membrane materials and methods of synthesis.

To date polymeric membranes have dominated the RO desalination industry. From the late 1950s to the 1980s the research effort focussed on the search for optimum polymeric membrane materials. In subsequent decades the performance of RO membranes has been optimised via control of membrane formation reactions, and the use of poly-condensation catalysts and additives. The performance of state-of-the-art RO membranes has been highlighted. Nevertheless, the advances in membrane permselectivity in the past decade has been relatively slow, and membrane fouling remains a severe problem.

The emergence of nano-technology in membrane materials science could offer an attractive alternative to polymeric materials. Hence nano-structured membranes are discussed in this review including zeolite membranes, thin film nano-composite membranes, carbon nano-tube membranes, and biomimetic membranes. It is proposed that these novel materials represent the most likely opportunities for enhanced RO desalination performance in the future, but that a number of challenges remain with regard to their practical implementation.},

The membrane showed high rejection efficiency for electrolytes such as pentanoic acid. An organic rejection of 96.5\% with a water flux of 0.33 kg m−2 h−1 was obtained for 100 ppm pentanoic acid solution at an operation pressure of 2.76 MPa. For non-electrolyte organics, separation efficiency is governed by the molecular dynamic size; the organics with larger molecular dynamic size show higher separation efficiency. The zeolite membrane gives an organic rejection of 99.5\% and 17\% for 100 ppm toluene and 100 ppm ethanol, respectively, with a water flux of 0.03 kg m−2 h−1, 0.31 kg m−2 h−1 at an operation pressure of 2.76 MPa. It was observed that organic rejection and water flux were affected by the organic concentration. As pentanoic acid concentration increased from 100 ppm to 500 ppm, both organic rejection and water flux decreased slightly.},

The algorithms have been implemented in a new module of the AMBER packages. This auxiliary module, antechamber (roughly meaning “before AMBER”), can be applied to generate necessary inputs of leap—the AMBER program to generate topologies for minimization, molecular dynamics, etc., for most organic molecules. The algorithms behind the manipulations may be useful for other molecular mechanical packages as well as applications that need to designate atom types and bond types.},

	abstract = {We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Å, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Å, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Å and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Upon mixing these compounds with other reactive mesogens, nematic, chiral nematic, and smectic or columnar liquid-crystalline phases can be formed that can be applied as actuators, sensors and responsive reflectors, and nanoporous membranes, respectively.},

Changes in structure, conductivity, hop path, site occupancies, bond lengths of framework atoms with composition are discussed. Average Na(1)−O distance shows a peak at x = 2, while Na(2)−O distance shows a monotonic increase. Sum of the sodium occupancies at Na(1) and mid-Na sites adds up to a constant value of one which supports the conclusion of Boilot et al.1 based on X-ray diffraction. Occupancy of Na(1) site attains a minimum at x = 2. The predominant conduction channel (which carries more than 90\% of the sodium ions) is found to be the one connecting Na(1)−mid-Na−Na(2). Density contours for sodium, depicting this conduction channel, are reported. Free energy profile along the conduction channel suggests that entropy contribution cannot be neglected.

The thermal property, density, self-diffusion coefficient of the anions and cations, viscosity, and ionic conductivity were measured for these ionic liquids in wide temperature ranges. A pulsed-gradient spin−echo NMR method was used to independently measure self-diffusion coefficients of the anions (19F NMR) and the cations (1H NMR). The results indicate that the cations diffuse almost equally to the anion in EMIBF4 and BPBF4, whereas they diffuse faster than the anion in EMITFSI and BPTFSI. The summation of the cationic and anionic diffusion coefficients for each ionic liquid follows the order EMITFSI {\textgreater} EMIBF4 {\textgreater} BPTFSI {\textgreater} BPBF4, under an isothermal condition. The order of the magnitude of the diffusion coefficient well contrasts with that of the viscosity for each ionic liquid. The temperature dependencies of the self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and ionic conductivity obey the Vogel−Tamman−Fulcher (VTF) equation, and the VTF parameters were presented. Relationships among the self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and molar conductivity were analyzed in terms of the Stokes−Einstein equation and the Nernst−Einstein equation. The most interesting feature of the relationships is that the ratios of the molar conductivity, determined by complex impedance measurements, to that calculated from the NMR diffusion coefficients, range from 0.6 to 0.8 for EMIBF4 and BPBF4, whereas the ratios range from 0.3 to 0.5 for EMITFSI and BPTFSI. This difference could be understood by taking the ionic association into consideration for EMITFSI and BPTFSI.},

The calculated diffusion coefficients and electric conductivities compare very well with the measurements across a wide composition range. We then extract static (radial distribution functions, coordination numbers distributions) and dynamic (cage correlation functions) quantities from the simulations. Then, we discuss the interplay between the microscopic structure of the molten salts and their dynamic properties. It is often considered that variations in the diffusion coefficient of the anions are mainly driven by the evolution of its coordination with the metallic ion (Y3+ here). We compare this system with fluorozirconate melts and demonstrate that the coordination number is a poor indicator of the evolution of the diffusion coefficient. Instead, we propose to use the ionic bonds lifetime. We show that the weak Y–F ionic bonds in LiF–YF3 do not induce the expected tendency of the fluoride diffusion coefficient to converge toward one of the yttrium cation when the content in YF3 increases. Implications on the validity of the Nernst-Einstein relation for estimating the electrical conductivity are discussed.},

At these temperatures, extrinsic defects were found to be prerequisite for diffusion of fluorine ions. During defect-free simulations, intrinsic disorder was not generated spontaneously. Fluorine migration procedes via a discrete vacancy “hopping” mechanism, in which the anion migration time is of at least an order of magnitude less than the average residence time at a given lattice site. This is in contrast to the partially correlated mechanism observed at temperatures approaching the simulated melting point for KCaF3, in which vacancies are generated by the formation of fluorine ion pairs occupying interstitial sites.},

	abstract = {α-Hemolysin of Staphylococcus aureus is a self-assembling toxin that forms a water-filled transmembrane channel upon oligomerization in a lipid membrane. Apart from being one of the best-studied toxins of bacterial origin, α-hemolysin is the principal component in several biotechnological applications, including systems for controlled delivery of small solutes across lipid membranes, stochastic sensors for small solutes, and an alternative to conventional technology for DNA sequencing. Through large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we studied the permeability of the α-hemolysin/lipid bilayer complex for water and ions. The studied system, composed of ∼300,000 atoms, included one copy of the protein, a patch of a DPPC lipid bilayer, and a 1 M water solution of KCl. Monitoring the fluctuations of the pore structure revealed an asymmetric, on average, cross section of the α-hemolysin stem. Applying external electrostatic fields produced a transmembrane ionic current; repeating simulations at several voltage biases yielded a current/voltage curve of α-hemolysin and a set of electrostatic potential maps. The selectivity of α-hemolysin to Cl− was found to depend on the direction and the magnitude of the applied voltage bias. The results of our simulations are in excellent quantitative agreement with available experimental data. Analyzing trajectories of all water molecule, we computed the α-hemolysin’s osmotic permeability for water as well as its electroosmotic effect, and characterized the permeability of its seven side channels. The side channels were found to connect seven His-144 residues surrounding the stem of the protein to the bulk solution; the protonation of these residues was observed to affect the ion conductance, suggesting the seven His-144 to comprise the pH sensor that gates conductance of the α-hemolysin channel.},

Increased insight into their functional mechanisms is crucial to enable drug design on this important class of membrane proteins, and to enhance our understanding of some of the fundamental features of cells. This review presents the concepts behind the recently developed simulation protocol Computational Electrophysiology (CompEL), which facilitates the atomistic simulation of ion channels in action. In addition, the review provides guidelines for its application in conjunction with the molecular dynamics software package GROMACS. We first lay out the rationale for designing CompEL as a method that models the driving force for ion permeation through channels the way it is established in cells, i.e., by electrochemical ion gradients across the membrane. This is followed by an outline of its implementation and a description of key settings and parameters helpful to users wishing to set up and conduct such simulations. In recent years, key mechanistic and biophysical insights have been obtained by employing the CompEL protocol to address a wide range of questions on ion channels and permeation. We summarize these recent findings on membrane proteins, which span a spectrum from highly ion-selective, narrow channels to wide diffusion pores. Finally we discuss the future potential of CompEL in light of its limitations and strengths. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Membrane Proteins edited by J.C.

To better understand the current-voltage (I-V) dependence of ion channels, here we describe and prove a collective diffusion model that quantitatively relates the spontaneous ion permeation at equilibrium to the stationary ionic fluxes driven by small voltages. The model makes it possible to determine the channel conductance in the linear I-V range from equilibrium simulations without the application of a voltage. To validate the theory, we perform molecular-dynamics simulations on two channels-a conical-shaped nanopore and the transmembrane pore of an α-hemolysin-under both equilibrium and nonequilibrium conditions. The simulations reveal substantial couplings between the motions of cations and anions, which are effectively captured by the collective coordinate in the model. Although the two channels exhibit very different linear ranges in the I-V curves, in both cases the channel conductance at small voltages is in reasonable agreement with the prediction from the equilibrium simulation. The simulations also suggest that channel charges, rather than geometric asymmetry, play a more prominent role in current rectification.},

The ultimate goal of such detailed simulations is to produce trajectories in which the behavior of the system is as realistic as possible. A critical aspect that requires consideration in the case of biological membrane systems is the existence of a net electric potential difference across the membrane. For meaningful computations, it is important to have well validated methodologies for incorporating the latter in molecular dynamics simulations. A widely used treatment of the membrane potential in molecular dynamics consists of applying an external uniform electric field E perpendicular to the membrane. The field acts on all charged particles throughout the simulated system, and the resulting applied membrane potential V is equal to the applied electric field times the length of the periodic cell in the direction perpendicular to the membrane. A series of test simulations based on simple membrane-slab models are carried out to clarify the consequences of the applied field. These illustrative tests demonstrate that the constant-field method is a simple and valid approach for accounting for the membrane potential in molecular dynamics studies of biomolecular systems.

The estimator, which we call the multistate Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (MBAR) because it reduces to the Bennett acceptance ratio estimator (BAR) when only two states are considered, has significant advantages over multiple histogram reweighting methods for combining data from multiple states. It does not require the sampled energy range to be discretized to produce histograms, eliminating bias due to energy binning and significantly reducing the time complexity of computing a solution to the estimating equations in many cases. Additionally, an estimate of the statistical uncertainty is provided for all estimated quantities. In the large sample limit, MBAR is unbiased and has the lowest variance of any known estimator for making use of equilibrium data collected from multiple states. We illustrate this method by producing a highly precise estimate of the potential of mean force for a DNA hairpin system, combining data from multiple optical tweezer measurements under constant force bias.},

Over the past decade, there have been intensive and continuous efforts in the development of TFC membrane, both from the industry and academia with the interests to further improve the membrane productivity and selectivity as well as its tolerance against chlorine, solvent, fouling, etc. On basis of a brief introduction of the development history of TFC membranes, this paper reviews the recent research progress of the TFC membrane science and technology, particularly in the fields of water-related separation processes. Reviewing the research progress is imperative and necessary in order to provide an insight for the future development and perhaps open a door to extend the applications to other more challenging areas.},

Thermodynamic and mechanical properties were calculated as a function of the cross-link density. A new relative reactivity volume (RRV) algorithm was developed to generate the cross-linking network by incorporating the correct regioselectivity (head-to-tail chain propagation) and monomer reactivity ratios. This is the first application of reactivity ratios for free radical addition polymerization in MD simulations. Prior cross-linking simulations were performed on step-growth epoxy resin curing. Vinyl esters studied here cure by free radical addition copolymerization. Cross-linked networks with double bond conversions up to 98\% were achieved. Volume shrinkage, glass transition temperatures, and tensile elastic constants were calculated. Predicted Young’s moduli were compared with experimental data. This RRV method can generate other thermoset and thermoplastic systems containing different monomers, and provide an approach for handling simultaneous irreversible reactions in MD simulations.},

	abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes.},

Inner loops are generated automatically in C or Fortran at compile time, with optimizations adapted to each architecture. Assembly loops using SSE and 3DNow! Multimedia instructions are provided for x86 processors, resulting in exceptional performance on inexpensive PC workstations. The interface is simple and easy to use (no scripting language), based on standard command line arguments with self-explanatory functionality and integrated documentation. All binary files are independent of hardware endian and can be read by versions of GROMACS compiled using different floating-point precision. A large collection of flexible tools for trajectory analysis is included, with output in the form of finished Xmgr/Grace graphs. A basic trajectory viewer is included, and several external visualization tools can read the GROMACS trajectory format.

For this system, using a polarizable Hamiltonian instead of the cheaper point-charge potentials is shown to have a significantly smaller effect on the stability at 250 K than on the lattice energy at 0 K. The benzene I polymorph is found to be the most stable crystal structure in all three potentials examined and at all temperatures examined. For each potential, we report the free energies over a range of temperatures and discuss the added value of using full free energy methods over the minimized lattice energy to determine the relative crystal stability at finite temperatures. The free energies in the polarizable Hamiltonian are efficiently calculated using samples collected in a cheaper point-charge potential. The polarizable free energies are estimated from the point-charge trajectories using Boltzmann reweighting with MBAR. The high configuration-space overlap necessary for efficient Boltzmann reweighting is achieved by designing point-charge potentials with intramolecular parameters matching those in the expensive polarizable Hamiltonian. Finally, we compare the computational cost of this indirect reweighted free energy estimate to the cost of simulating directly in the expensive polarizable Hamiltonian.},

	abstract = {Formulators are charged with the responsibility to formulate a product which is physically and chemically stable, manufacturable, and bioavailable. Most drugs exhibit structural polymorphism, and it is preferable to develop the most thermodynamically stable polymorph of the drug to assure reproducible bioavailability of the product over its shelf life under a variety of real-world storage conditions. There are occasional situations in which the development of a metastable crystalline or amorphous form is justified because a medical benefit is achieved. Such situations include those in which a faster dissolution rate or higher concentration are desired, in order to achieve rapid absorption and efficacy, or to achieve acceptable systemic exposure for a low-solubility drug. Another such situation is one in which the drug remains amorphous despite extensive efforts to crystallize it. If there is no particular medical benefit, there is less justification for accepting the risks of intentional development of a metastable crystalline or amorphous form. Whether or not there is medical benefit, the risks associated with development of a metastable form must be mitigated by laboratory work which provides assurance that (a) the largest possible form change will have no substantive effect on product quality or bioavailability, and/or (b) a change will not occur under all reasonable real-world storage conditions, and/or (c) analytical methodology and sampling procedures are in place which assure that a problem will be detected before dosage forms which have compromised quality or bioavailability can reach patients.},

	abstract = {We investigate the fundamental factors controlling polymorphism in 5-fluorouracil by performing molecular dynamics simulations of solutions of the compound in water, nitromethane, and wet nitromethane. Analysis of the effect of solvent on the initial aggregation of 5-fluorouracil molecules shows that the strong binding of water to the 5-fluorouracil molecule hinders the formation of the doubly hydrogen-bonded dimer and, by default, promotes close hydrophobic F···F interactions that are a feature of the unusual (Z‘ = 4) structure of form I. In contrast, doubly hydrogen-bonded dimers are observed to form readily in solution in dry nitromethane, consistent with the crystallization of the doubly hydrogen-bonded ribbon structure of form II from this solvent. When nitromethane is doped with water, the water forms hydrogen bonds to the solute, interfering with the formation of the doubly hydrogen-bonded dimers, which is consistent with the crystallization of form I from this hygroscopic solvent when it is not dried. Overall, the molecular dynamics simulations provide an atomistic picture of how solvent−solute interactions can significantly affect the initial association of 5-fluorouracil molecules to the extent that they determine the polymorphic outcome of the crystallization.},

The aim of this work was to obtain the different polymorphic modifications of the anticonvulsant drug, carbamazepine, and to characterise them by means of typical structure-sensitive analytical techniques, such as FT-IR spectroscopy, XRPD and DSC. Further investigations were also performed by Hot Stage FT-IR thermomicroscopy, which permitted the visible and spectroscopic characterisation of the polymorphic forms during heating. Our results confirm the existence of three different polymorphic forms for anhydrous carbamazepine: Form III, the commercial one, Form I, obtained by heating Form III and Form II, crystallised from ethanolic solution. Substantial differences were detected among the polymorphs with regard to solid-state properties. Moreover, Hot Stage FT-IR thermomicroscopy proved its analytical potential to characterise the drug's polymorphism.},

Investigation of this phenomena revealed the existence of a crystal form of ritonavir other than the one already known (Form I). This new crystal form was designated as Form II.

	abstract = {The polymorphism, crystal habits, and solubility of 1,8-dihydroxyanthraquinone (danthron) were investigated in acetic acid, acetone, acetonitrile, n-butanol, and toluene. The solubility was determined for the commercially available form (FI) from 293.15 K to 318.15 K by the gravimetric method. The influence of solvents on crystal habit and polymorphic form has been investigated. Three different crystal habits of danthron were obtained from slow evaporation and cooling experiments. By evaporation, thin squares of FI were obtained from n-butanol and toluene solutions while both FI and fine needles of FII were obtained from acetone and acetonitrile solutions. In addition, needle-shaped solvate crystals were obtained from acetic acid solutions and the structure of the solvate was solved by single crystal X-ray diffraction. From cooling crystallization experiments, mixtures of FI and FII were often obtained from various solvents, but FI and FII possess distinct habits which can be easily distinguished by visual comparison. Slurry conversion experiments have established that FI is the thermodynamically stable polymorph of danthron at ambient conditions. Differntial scanning calorimetry (DSC) and high-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) have shown that both FI and FII will transform into a high-temperature form (FIV) around 435 K to 439 K before this form melts at 468.5 K. FI, FII, and FIV have been characterized by transmission and high-temperature PXRD, scanning electron microscopy, infrared spectrometry, Raman spectrometry, thermogravimetric analysis, and DSC. The solubility of danthron FI in the pure organic solvents of the present work and in the temperature range investigated is below 4.3 \% by weight and decreases in the order toluene, acetone, acetonitrile, and n-butanol.},

We observe that the substrate temperature has a dramatic impact on the crystal growth, producing two distinct polymorphs of TMS-DBC; low temperature (LT) fine red needles and high temperature (HT) large yellow platelets. Single crystal X-ray crystallography confirms packing structures where the LT crystals form a 1D slipped-stack structure, while the HT crystals adopt a 2D brickwork motif. These polymorphs also represent a rare example where both are extremely stable and do not interconvert to the other crystal structure upon solvent or thermal annealing. Single crystal organic field-effect transistors of the LT and HT crystals show that the HT 2D brickwork motif produces hole mobilities as high as 2.1 cm2 V–1 s–1, while the mobility of the 1D structure is significantly lower, at 0.028 cm2 V–1 s–1. Electronic-structure calculations indicate that the superior charge transport in the brickwork polymorph in comparison to the slipped-stack polymorph is due to the presence of an increased dimensionality of the charge migration pathways.},

In2O3, using a hybrid density functional theory approach, we assess the impact of the loss of inversion symmetry and the distortion of the oxide sublattice on the electronic and defect
structure. The band structure of the orthorhombic phase retains the key features of a transparent conductive oxide, with a large separation between the fundamental and optical band gaps. The dominant point defect—the oxygen vacancy—shows similar behavior in both

We have therefore performed a systematic crystal structure prediction search for minima in the lattice energy of crystalline paracetamol. The stable monoclinic form is found as the global lattice-energy minimum, but there are at least a dozen energetically feasible structures found, including the well-characterized metastable orthorhombic phase. Hence, we require additional criteria to reduce the number of hypothetical crystal structures that can be considered as potential polymorphs. For this purpose the elastic properties and vapor growth morphology of the known and predicted structures have been estimated using second-derivative analysis and the attachment-energy model. These inexpensive calculations give reasonable agreement with the available experimental data for the known polymorphs. Some of the hypothetical structures are predicted to have a low growth rate and platelike morphology, and so are unlikely to be observed. Another is only marginally mechanically stable. Thus, this first consideration of such properties in a crystal-structure prediction study appears to reduce the number of predicted polymorphs while leaving a few candidates for the uncharacterized form.},

Raman spectra of CAPE cocrystals complement these results in confirming the formation of novel crystalline phases.

The results demonstrate that the transformation process consists of three steps, involving the dissolution of Form II, the nucleation of Form I, and the following growth of Form I. The ATR-FTIR and Raman results show that the polymorphic transformation from Form II to Form I is controlled by the nucleation and growth of Form I. Furthermore, the microscope photographs clearly reveal that the Form I preferably nucleates and grows on the (100) surface of Form II. The molecular simulation results indicate that higher adsorption energy and the exposure of more activity groups make the molecule adsorbed more strongly on the (100) surface, which is in agreement with the experimental observation. The results drawn in this work will be of great significance to control the formation of a desired polymorphic final product of ethenzamide–saccharin cocrystal.},

	abstract = {Crystal structure prediction methods have been used to explore the potential energy landscape for crystals of a melatonin agonist (MA). All known experimental polymorphs were found in the search for crystal packing alternatives with a single molecule in the asymmetric unit, and the predicted order of stability agrees with experiment. The crystal structure corresponding to the global minimum has not been observed experimentally, but analysis of the crystal structures of similar molecules in the Cambridge Structural Database (CSD) indicates that the packing motif present in the predicted structure is also found in nature. To date it has not been experimentally possible to crystallize the most stable polymorph of the biologically active R-enantiomer, whereas the S-enantiomer readily crystallizes in the stable form. Analysis of the results shows that this polymorph has an uncommon packing motif which is found just once among the 12 lowest energy predicted structures but is seen in two crystal structures of MA-like molecules whose structures are stored in the CSD. On the basis of the calculations and comparisons with experimental crystal structures, suggestions are made as to possible routes for crystallizing the, as yet unknown, polymorph of MA, which corresponds to the predicted structure with the lowest lattice energy.},

	abstract = {Rotigotine is a highly lipophilic dopamine-receptor agonist and the first transdermally delivered agent to demonstrate efficacy and safety as monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease and to reduce "off" hours in levodopa-treated patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. The rotigotine pharmacophore is nonergolinic and demonstrates high affinity for dopamine D(2) and D(3) receptors. With once-daily application, the patch matrix provides continuous, nonfluctuating plasma drug levels at steady state, resulting in continuous and steady plasma and brain levels and striatal dopamine-receptor stimulation. In early Parkinson's disease, doses of rotigotine up to 8 mg/24 hours demonstrate comparable efficacy to ropinirole (at doses up to 12 mg/day); in advanced Parkinson's disease, doses of rotigotine up to 16 mg/24 hours demonstrate comparable efficacy and tolerability to pramipexole (at doses up to 4.5 mg/day). In the registration trials for early and advanced Parkinson's disease, the adverse effects most commonly observed with rotigotine were minor application site reactions, dizziness, nausea, and somnolence. Doses of transdermal rotigotine can be titrated to a maintenance dose within 2-3 weeks, and the once-daily regimen minimizes complexity of therapy. The transdermal delivery system is also an advantage when nonoral administration is desired, and the 24-hour, continuous, nonfluctuating drug levels can improve early morning and nocturnal symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Thus, transdermally delivered rotigotine is a clinically innovative and useful addition to the dopamine-receptor agonist class. This review summarizes the key pharmacologic and clinical data for rotigotine and provides a focused clinical context for its use in early-to-advanced Parkinson's disease, as well as a brief summary for its role in restless legs syndrome.},

MD simulations using a quantum-chemistry-based many-body polarizable force field yielded ion self-diffusion coefficients, electrolyte conductivity, ion aggregation, and the coordination environment of Li+ in good agreement with experiment. Lithium transport was found to arise from a combination of the subdiffusive Li+ motion along PEO chains, motion together with PEO segments and intersegmental Li+ hops from one PEO segment to another. The rate of intersegmental hops was found to correlate well with times at which Li+ motion crosses over from subdiffusive to diffusive behavior. The contribution of Li+ motion along PEO chains to the total Li+ transport was found to be approximately equal to the contribution from Li+ moving together with PEO segments. Diffusion of both Li+ and TFSI- was found to be strongly coupled to PEO ether oxygen atom displacements and PEO conformational dynamics.},

	abstract = {This article reports on the calibration and validation of a new GROMOS-compatible parameter set 2016H66 for small organic molecules in the condensed phase. The calibration is based on 62 organic molecules spanning the chemical functions alcohol, ether, aldehyde, ketone, carboxylic acid, ester, amine, amide, thiol, sulfide, and disulfide, as well as aromatic compounds and nucleic-acid bases. For 57 organic compounds, the calibration targets are the experimental pure-liquid density ρliq and the vaporization enthalpy ΔHvap, as well as the hydration free energy ΔGwat and the solvation free energy ΔGche in cyclohexane, at atmospheric pressure and at (or close to) room temperature. The final root-mean-square deviations (RMSD) for these four quantities over the set of compounds are 32.4 kg m–3, 3.5 kJ mol–1, 4.1 kJ mol–1, and 2.1 kJ mol–1, respectively, and the corresponding average deviations (AVED) are 1.0 kg m–3, 0.2 kJ mol–1, 2.6 kJ mol–1, and 1.0 kJ mol–1, respectively. For the five nucleic-acid bases, the parametrization is performed by transferring the final 2016H66 parameters from analogous organic compounds followed by a slight readjustment of the charges to reproduce the experimental water-to-chloroform transfer free energies ΔGtrn. The final RMSD for this quantity over the five bases is 1.7 kJ mol–1, and the corresponding AVED is 0.8 kJ mol–1. As an initial validation of the 2016H66 set, seven additional thermodynamic, transport, and dielectric properties are calculated for the 57 organic compounds in the liquid phase. The agreement with experiment in terms of these additional properties is found to be reasonable, with significant deviations typically affecting either a specific chemical function or a specific molecule. This suggests that in most cases, a classical force-field description along with a careful parametrization against ρliq, ΔHvap, ΔGwat, and ΔGche results in a model that appropriately describes the liquid in terms of a wide spectrum of its physical properties.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses small-angle scattering experiments with particles in solution—i.e., the particles are nonoriented. A large number of particles contribute to the scattering and the resulting spatial average leads to a loss in information. The information contained in the three-dimensional electron density distribution is thereby reduced to the one-dimensional distance distribution function. This function is proportional to the number of lines with length, which connect any volume element i with any volume element k of the same particle. The spatial orientation of these connection lines is of no account to the function. The connection lines are weighted by the product of the number of electrons situated in the volume elements i and k, respectively. The correlation between the function and the structure of the particle is also discussed in the chapter. The connection between the distance distribution function and the measured experimental scattering curve is also shown. It is observed that the each distance between two electrons of the particle, which is part of the function, leads to an angular-dependent scattering intensity. This physical process of scattering can be mathematically expressed by a Fourier transformation, which defines the way in which the information in “real space” (distance distribution function) is transformed into “reciprocal space” (scattering function). The chapter also discusses monochromatization and the camera type developed in Graz.},

The difference between the estimated CCSD(T) basis set limit electronic binding energies for the T and PD shapes appears to amount to more than 0.3 kcal/mol, indicating the PD shape is a more stable configuration than the T shape for this dimer in the gas phase. This conclusion is further strengthened when a vibrational zero-point correction to the electronic binding energies of this dimer is made, which increases the difference between the two configurations to 0.4−0.5 kcal/mol. The binding energies of 2.4 and 2.8 kcal/mol for the T and PD configurations are in good accord with the previous experimental result from ionization potential measurement.},

	abstract = {We computed the transport of methane through 1 nm wide slit-shaped pores carved out of solid substrates. Models for silica, magnesium oxide, and alumina were used as solid substrates. The pores were filled with water. The results show that the methane permeability through the hydrated pores is strongly dependent on the solid substrate. Detailed analysis of the simulated systems reveals that local properties of confined water, including its structure, and more importantly, evolution of solvation free energy and hydrogen bond structure are responsible for the pronounced differences observed. The simulations are extended to multicomponent systems representative of natural gas, containing methane, ethane, and H2S. The results show that all pores considered have high affinity for H2S, moderate affinity for methane, and low affinity for ethane. The H2S/methane transport selectivity through the hydrated alumina pore is comparable, or superior, to that reported for existing commercial membranes. A multiscale approach was then implemented to demonstrate that a Smoluchowski one-dimensional model is able to reproduce the molecular-level results for short pores when appropriate values for the local self-diffusion coefficients are used as input parameters. We propose that the model can be extended to predict methane transport through uniform hydrated pores of macroscopic length. When verified by experiments, our simulation results could have important implications in applications such as natural gas sweetening and predictions of methane migration through hydraulically fractured shale formations.},

	abstract = {The shortage of available fresh water is one of the global issues presently faced by humanity. To determine a solution to this problem, the survival strategies of plants have been examined. In this study, a nature-inspired membrane with a highly charged surface is proposed as an effective membrane for the filtration of saline water. To mimic the desalination characteristics of mangrove roots, a macroporous membrane based on polyethylene terephthalate is treated with polyelectrolytes using a layer-by-layer deposition method. The fabricated membrane surface has a highly negative charged ζ-potential value of −97.5 ± 4.3 mV, similar to that of the first layer of mangrove roots. Desalination of saline water using this membrane shows a high salt retention rate of 96.5\%. The highly charged surface of the membrane may induce a relatively thick and stable ion depletion zone in front of the membrane. As a result, most co-ions are repelled from the membrane surface, and counterions are also rejected by virtue of their electroneutrality. The water permeability is found to be 7.60–7.69 L/m2·h, which is 10 times higher than that of the reverse osmosis desalination method. This nature-inspired filtration membrane exhibits steady desalination performance over 72 h of operation, successfully demonstrating the stable filtration of saline water. This nature-inspired membrane is applicable to the design of a small-scale, portable, and energy-free desalination device for use in third-world countries or small villages.},

Of these derivatives, only the l-alanine derivative (1) was found to form the HII phase, using N,N-dimethylformamide as the hydrophilic solvent. To our knowledge, this is one of the rare examples (if not the only example) of a Brønsted acidic amphiphile capable of forming a high-curvature LLC phase. Monomer 1 was also found to be able to direct the formation of the other amide-containing acidic derivatives into the HII phase when blended together.

However, basis sets even larger than aug-cc-pVTZ are important for accurate binding energies. The complete basis set MP2 binding energies, estimated by explicitly correlated MP2−R12/A techniques, are significantly larger in magnitude than previous estimates. When corrected for higher-order correlation effects via coupled cluster with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)], the binding energies De (D0) for the sandwich, T-shaped, and parallel-displaced configurations are found to be 1.8 (2.0), 2.7 (2.4), and 2.8 (2.7) kcal mol-1, respectively.},

Soc. 1992, 114, 5729), electron-withdrawing substituents enhance binding in the benzene dimer by withdrawing electron density from the π-cloud of the substituted ring, reducing the repulsive electrostatic interaction with the nonsubstituted benzene. Conversely, electron-donating substituents donate excess electrons into the π-system and diminish the π-stacking interaction. We present computed interaction energies for the sandwich configuration of the benzene dimer and 24 substituted dimers, as well as sandwich complexes of substituted benzenes with perfluorobenzene. While the computed interaction energies correlate well with σm values for the substituents, interaction energies for related model systems demonstrate that this trend is independent of the substituted ring. Instead, the observed trends are consistent with direct electrostatic and dispersive interactions of the substituents with the unsubstituted ring.},

A united atom model is employed for the surfactants with fully atomistic counterions and water. This gemini architecture, in which two single tailed surfactants are joined through a flexible hydrophobic linker, has been shown to exhibit concentration-dependent aqueous self-assembly into lyotropic phases including hexagonal, gyroid, and lamellar morphologies. Our simulations reproduce the experimentally observed phases at similar amphiphile concentrations in water, including the unusual ability of these surfactants to form gyroid phases over unprecedentedly large amphiphile concentration windows. We demonstrate quantitative agreement between the predicted and experimentally observed domain spacings of these nanostructured materials. Through careful conformation analyses of the surfactant molecules, we show that the gyroid phase is electrostatically stabilized related to the lamellar phase. By starting with a lamellar phase, we show that use of a bulkier N(CH3)4+ counterion in place of Na+ drives the formation of a gyroid phase. Decreasing the charge on the surfactant headgroups by carboxylate protonation decreases the degree of order in the lamellar phase. Using our models, we show that the translational diffusion of water and the Na+ counterions is decreased by several orders of magnitude over the studied concentration range, and we attribute these effects to strong correlations between the mobile species and the surfactant headgroups.},

	abstract = {Adequate initial configurations for molecular dynamics simulations consist of arrangements of molecules distributed in space in such a way to approximately represent the system's overall structure. In order that the simulations are not disrupted by large van der Waals repulsive interactions, atoms from different molecules must keep safe pairwise distances. Obtaining such a molecular arrangement can be considered a packing problem: Each type molecule must satisfy spatial constraints related to the geometry of the system, and the distance between atoms of different molecules must be greater than some specified tolerance. We have developed a code able to pack millions of atoms, grouped in arbitrarily complex molecules, inside a variety of three-dimensional regions. The regions may be intersections of spheres, ellipses, cylinders, planes, or boxes. The user must provide only the structure of one molecule of each type and the geometrical constraints that each type of molecule must satisfy. Building complex mixtures, interfaces, solvating biomolecules in water, other solvents, or mixtures of solvents, is straightforward. In addition, different atoms belonging to the same molecule may also be restricted to different spatial regions, in such a way that more ordered molecular arrangements can be built, as micelles, lipid double-layers, etc. The packing time for state-of-the-art molecular dynamics systems varies from a few seconds to a few minutes in a personal computer.

	abstract = {The suitability of a hybrid density functional to qualitatively reproduce geometric and energetic details of parallel π-stacked aromatic complexes is presented. The hybrid functional includes an ad hoc mixture of half the exact (HF) exchange with half of the uniform electron gas exchange, plus Lee, Yang, and Parr's expression for correlation energy. This functional, in combination with polarized, diffuse basis sets, gives a binding energy for the parallel-displaced benzene dimer in good agreement with the best available high-level calculations reported in the literature, and qualitatively reproduces the local MP2 potential energy surface of the parallel-displaced benzene dimer. This method was further critically compared to high-level calculations recently reported in the literature for a range of π-stacked complexes, including monosubstituted benzene–benzene dimers, along with DNA and RNA bases, and generally agrees with MP2 and/or CCSD(T) results to within ±2 kJ mol−1. We also show that the resulting BH\&H binding energy is closely related to the electron density in the intermolecular region. The net result is that the BH\&H functional, presumably due to fortuitous cancellation of errors, provides a pragmatic, computationally efficient quantum mechanical tool for the study of large π-stacked systems such as DNA. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The energetics of substituted T-shaped configurations are more complex, but nevertheless a simple model that accounts for electrostatic and dispersion interactions (and direct contacts between substituents on one ring and hydrogen atoms on the other), provides a good match to the quantum mechanical results.

	abstract = {Nanofiltration membranes (NF) have applications in several areas. One of the main applications has been in watertreatment for drinking water production as well as wastewater treatment. NF can either be used to treat all kinds of water including ground, surface, and wastewater or used as a pretreatment for desalination. The introduction of NF as a pretreatment is considered a breakthrough for the desalination process. NF membranes have been shown to be able to remove turbidity, microorganisms and hardness, as well as a fraction of the dissolved salts. This results in a significantly lower operating pressure and thus provides a much more energy-efficient process. Similar to other membrane processes, a major problem in NF membrane applications is fouling. Several studies have investigated the mechanisms of fouling in NF membranes and suggested methods to minimize and control the fouling of NF membranes. For NF membrane characterizations and process prediction, modeling of NF processes and the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) are very important. The ability to predict the performance of NF processes will lead to a lower number of experiments, saving of time and money, and help to understand the separation mechanisms during NF. A comprehensive review of NF in water treatments is presented including a review of the applications of NF in treating water as well as in the pretreatment process for desalination; the mechanism as well as minimization of NF membrane fouling problems; and theories for modelling and transport of salt, charged and noncharged organic compounds in NF membranes. The review will also address the application of AFM in studying the morphology of membrane surfaces as part of the NF membrane characterization.},

	abstract = {In spite of all promising perspectives for nanofiltration, not only in drinking water production but also in wastewater treatment, the food industry, the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, and many other industries, there are still some unresolved problems that slow down large-scale applications. This paper identifies six challenges for nanofiltration where solutions are still scarce: (1) avoiding membrane fouling, and possibilities to remediate, (2) improving the separation between solutes that can be achieved, (3) further treatment of concentrates, (4) chemical resistance and limited lifetime of membranes, (5) insufficient rejection of pollutants in water treatment, and (6) the need for modelling and simulation tools.
The implementation of nanofiltration in the industry is a success story because these challenges can be dealt with for many applications, whereas more research would result in many more possible applications. It is suggested that these challenges should be among the main priorities on the research agenda for nanofiltration. This paper offers an overview of the state-of-the-art in these areas, without going into details about specific observations in individual studies, but rather aiming at giving the overall picture of possible drawbacks. This leads to suggestions which direction the nanofiltration research community should follow, and where research questions can be found. Evidently, the six identified challenges are to some extent interrelated; mutual influences are explained as well as possible solutions, or possible pathways to solutions.},

	abstract = {Nanofiltration membranes (NFMs) are widely used in saline water desalination, wastewater treatment, and chemical product purification. However, conventional NFMs suffer from broad pore size distribution, which limits their applications for fine separation, especially in complete separation of molecules with slight differences in molecular size. Herein, defect-free composite NFMs with narrow pore size distribution are fabricated using a contra-diffusion method, with dopamine/polyethylenimine solution on the skin side and ammonium persulfate solution on the other side of the ultrafiltration substrate. Persulfate ions can diffuse through the ultrafiltration substrate into the other side and in situ trigger dopamine to form a codeposited coating with polyethylenimine. The codeposition is hindered on those sites completely covered by the polydopamine/polyethylenimine coating, although it is promoted at the defects or highly permeable regions because it is induced by the diffused persulfate ions. Such a “self-completion” process results in NFMs with highly uniform structures and narrow pore size distribution, as determined by their rejection of neutral solutes. These near electrically neutral NFMs show a high rejection of divalent ions with a low rejection of monovalent ions (MgCl2 rejection = 96\%, NaCl rejection = 23\%), majorly based on a steric hindrance effect. The as-prepared NFMs can be applied in molecular separation such as isolating cellulose hydrogenation products.},

The effect of the important driving forces in these separations, viz., pressure, concentration, temperature and electric field strength, has been investigated. These results show that the water and methanol molecules cluster strongly around the ions in these simulations, and this plays a significant role in membrane based separations in both aqueous and methanolic solutions-an effect of which the importance was not previously recognized. In addition, studies have been made of the self-diffusion coefficients and density profiles in these systems.

	abstract = {A critical assessment of previous theoretical descriptions of membrane nanofiltration shows that the good agreement with experimental data is due to the use of the ratio of effective membrane thickness to membrane porosity as an arbitrary fitting parameter. A more rigorous analysis shows that rejection is independent of membrane thickness.
A model allowing calculation of uncharged solute rejection on the basis of a single membrane parameter (pore radius) is developed. The theoretical description is based on a hydrodynamic model of hindered solute transport in pores. The dependence of solute chemical potential on pressure is included, although its effect is shown to be small. A variation of solvent viscosity with pore radius is also included. For pores of a single size, such variation has no effect on rejection, though it will become important for overall membrane rejection if a pore size distribution is included. The good agreement between this model and experimental data confirms that uncharged solute rejection in nanofiltration membranes may be well-described by such a continuum model.
A two-parameter model (pore radius and membrane charge) for electrolyte rejection has been developed that includes dielectric exclusion in the form of an energy barrier to ion partitioning into the pores. Reassessment of the pore dielectric constant using NaCl rejection at the isoelectric point of a Desal-DK membrane resulted in significantly better agreement with experimental rejection data than use of the high frequency solvent dielectric constant for an oriented layer of water molecules at the pore walls. The predicted values of effective membrane charge density were not only significantly reduced in magnitude, and hence more realistic, than those from previous models, but their variation with concentration for divalent salts was in better agreement with physical models of ion adsorption.
The theoretical descriptions of the present paper are developed more rigorously than those previously published. Their overall agreement with experimental data is good and the resulting membrane parameters are likely to be more closely related to physical membrane properties than those obtained from previous models. The descriptions are useful for membrane process assessment and prediction. They also provide a sound basis for further developments.},

Despite its fundamental clinical importance, the mechanism of amyloid formation is not fully understood. When we analyzed a variety of short functional fragments from unrelated amyloid-forming proteins, a remarkable occurrence of aromatic residues was observed. The finding of aromatic residues in diverse fragments raises the possibility that π-π interactions may play a significant role in the molecular recognition and self-assembly processes that lead to amyloid formation. This is in line with the well-known central role of π-stacking interactions in self-assembly processes in the fields of chemistry and biochemistry. We speculate that the stacking interactions may provide energetic contribution as well as order and directionality in the self-assembly of amyloid structures. Experimental data regarding amyloid formation and inhibition by short peptide analogs also support our hypothesis. The π-stacking hypothesis suggests a new approach to understanding the self-assembly mechanism that governs amyloid formation and indicates possible ways to control this process.—Gazit, E.

Remarkably, multiple substituents have an additive effect on the binding energy of sandwich dimers, except in some cases when substituents are aligned on top of each other. The energetics of substituted T-shaped configurations are more complex, but nevertheless a simple model that accounts for electrostatic and dispersion interactions (and direct contacts between substituents on one ring and hydrogen atoms on the other), provides a good match to the quantum mechanical results.

	abstract = {The effects of log-normal pore size distributions on the rejection of uncharged solutes and NaCl at hypothetical nanofiltration membranes have been assessed theoretically. The importance of pore radius-dependent properties such as solvent viscosity and dielectric constant is increased by the introduction of a pore size distribution in calculations. However, the effect of porewise variation in viscosity is less apparent when considered at a defined applied pressure rather than at a defined flux, showing a further advantage of basing theoretical analysis of nanofiltration in terms of applied pressure.
Truncated pore size distributions gave better agreement than full distributions with experimental rejection data for a Desal-DK nanofiltration membrane. Such truncation is in agreement with the findings of atomic force microscopy (AFM). Analysis of uncharged solute rejection data alone could not give useful information about membrane pore size distribution. Neither could such a distribution be obtained quantitatively directly from AFM images. However, use of the shape of the distribution obtained by AFM in conjunction with experimental rejection data for an uncharged solute allows calculation of corrected distributions. Importantly, incorporation of such a corrected pore size distribution in calculations of NaCl rejection gave better agreement with experimental data, compared to calculations assuming uniform pores, at high pressure, the region of industrial interest.},

Without the alkane, the wedge-shaped molecules form liquid crystal columns with 3 dendrons in a supramolecular disk. The same structure exists in the blend, but on heating one dendron is expelled from the disks in every third column and is replaced by the alkane. This superlattice of unequal columns is confirmed by complementary X-ray and neutron diffraction studies. Lateral thermal expansion of dendrons normally leads to the expulsion of excess molecules from the column, reducing the column diameter. However, in the already narrow columns of pure Li salt, expulsion of one of only three dendrons in a disk is not viable. The added alkane facilitates the expulsion, as it replaces the missing dendron. Replacing the alkane with a functional compound can potentially lead to active nanoarrays with relatively large periodicity by using only small molecules.},

	abstract = {Synthesis and modes of self-assembly are described for the tapered monodendritic molecules 3,4, 5-nGi-X of generation i=1, 2, 3 (see structures below) that contain multiple (CH2)nH alkyl chains on their periphery (n=12, 14, 16) and a polar group X at the apex (X=COOH, COONa, COOCs, CO(OCH2CH2)3OH). These monodendrons self-assemble into supramolecular cylindrical or spherical dendrimers, which in turn self-organise into p6mm columnar or Pm3¯n cubic thermotropic liquid crystals, respectively. The two principal ways of affecting the self-assembly of these compounds by means of their molecular architecture are: a) by changing the width of the wide (aliphatic) end, and b) by changing the volume at the apex. In the present work a) is controlled through temperature (conformational disorder) and b) is controlled by changing the generation number i or the size of X, for example, through the choice of metal cation. The single most important geometric parameter of these dendritic building blocks is the molecular solid angle (taper angle) α; a high α leads to spherical and a low α to cylindrical supramolecular dendrimers. Furthermore, α also determines the equilibrium size of the supramolecular objects; a larger α results in a smaller diameter. The unusually strong negative thermal expansion coefficient of the cubic and columnar lattice is attributed to the excess of the increasingly highly tapered molecules being rejected from their parent aggregates and reassembling as new ones. Increasing α is also considered to be responsible for the observed thermotropic columnar-cubic transition.},

The approach exploits a structure-directing molecule to template the assembly of plant-derived fatty acids into highly ordered columnar mesophases. Directed self-assembly using physical confinement and magnetic fields provides vertical alignment of the columnar nanostructures in large area (several cm2) thin films. Chemically cross-linking the mesophase with added conventional vinyl comonomers and removing the molecular template results in a mechanically robust polymer film with vertically aligned 1.2–1.5 nm diameter nanopores with a large specific surface area of ∼670 m2/g. The nanoporous polymer films display exceptional size and charge selectivity as demonstrated by adsorption experiments using model penetrant molecules. These materials have significant potential to function as high-performance nanofiltration membranes and as nanoporous thin films for high-density lithographic pattern transfer. The scalability of the fabrication process suggests that practical applications can be reasonably anticipated.},

	abstract = {Wood, an earth-abundant material, is widely used in our everyday life. With its mesoporous structure, natural wood is comprised of numerous long, partially aligned channels (lumens) as well as nanochannels that stretch along its growth direction. This wood mesostructure is suitable for a range of emerging applications, especially as a membrane/separation material. Here, we report a mesoporous, three-dimensional (3D) wood membrane decorated with palladium nanoparticles (Pd NPs/wood membrane) for efficient wastewater treatment. The 3D Pd NPs/wood membrane possesses the following advantages: (1) the uniformly distributed lignin within the wood mesostructure can effectively reduce Pd(II) ions to Pd NPs; (2) cellulose, with its abundant hydroxyl groups, can immobilize Pd NPs; (3) the partially aligned mesoporous wood channels as well as their inner ingenious microstructures increase the likelihood of wastewater contacting Pd NPs decorating the wood surface; (4) the long, Pd NP-decorated channels facilitate bulk treatment as water flows through the entire mesoporous wood membrane. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the use and efficiency of a Pd NPs/wood membrane to remove methylene blue (MB, C16H18N3ClS) from a flowing aqueous solution. The turnover frequency of the Pd NPs/wood membrane, ∼2.02 molMB·molPd–1·min–1, is much higher than the values reported in the literature. The water treatment rate of the 3D Pd NPs/wood membrane can reach 1 × 105 L·m–2·h–1 with a high MB removal efficiency ({\textgreater}99.8\%). The 3D mesoporous wood membrane with partially aligned channels exhibits promising results for wastewater treatment and is applicable for an even wider range of separation applications.},

The model features both perpendicular and parallel water flow across multiple sheets of pristine and/or oxidized graphene to simulate “brick-and-mortar” microstructures. Additionally, regions of pristine/oxidized graphene overlap that have thus far been overlooked in the literature are explored. Differences in orientational and hydrogen-bonding features between adjacent layers of water in this mixed region are found to be even more prominent than differences between pristine and oxidized channels. This region also shows lateral water flow in equilibrium simulations and orthogonal flow in non-equilibrium simulations significantly greater than those in the oxidized region, suggesting it may play a non-negligible role in the mechanism of water flow across graphene oxide membranes.},

	abstract = {A thin-film composite, bicontinuous cubic lyotropic liquid crystal polymer (TFC QI) membrane with uniform-size, ionic nanopores was studied for the treatment of hydraulic fracturing flowback water. The TFC QI membrane performance was compared to those of a commercial nanofiltration (NF) membrane (NF270) and a commercial reverse osmosis (RO) membrane (SW30HR) for the filtration of flowback water from the Denver-Julesburg Basin. The permeability, salt rejection, and organic solute rejection for each membrane was evaluated. The results illustrate that the TFC QI membrane maintained its performance to a similar degree as the commercial NF and RO membranes while demonstrating a unique selectivity not observed in the commercial membranes. Specifically, the TFC QI membrane rejected 75\% of the salt while recovering 9.6\% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 50\% of the water. Of particular interest was the recovery of labile DOC, which was assessed through biodegradation experiments. Analysis following biodegradation of the TFC QI membrane permeate demonstrates the membrane's ability to recover labile DOC in a reduced-saline permeate. Improved recovery of labile DOC (increased to 22\%) was demonstrated by reducing the pH of the flowback water. Therefore, the selectivity of the TFC QI membrane provides an opportunity to recover resources from hydraulic fracturing flowback.},

	abstract = {The aliphatic chains of many biologically important lipids are heterogeneous and often related to the functions of the molecules. Certain phospholipids containing arachidonic acid may serve as precursors for prostaglandins, certain diglycerides may serve as second messengers for certain membrane-triggered reactions (43), and other phospholipids containing a very short chain in the two position may serve as vasoactive hormones (44). The packing of such molecules is of interest. The evidence is quite clear from both the conformation of saturated and unsaturated molecules and from mixing experiments in the solid state that long and short chains don't mix well, nor do unsaturated and saturated chains, even if they are of the same chain length. There is even some evidence to indicate that some degree of chain segregation occurs even in the liquid state. However, different chains are often associated through covalent bonds, e.g., in wax esters, diacylglycerols, triacylglycerols, and phospholipids. A variety of possibilities for chain segregation are present in the neat phases of wax esters, ceramides, diacylglycerols, and triacylglycerols. However, in the unique case of membrane lipids like phospholipids or sphingolipids, the two chains are forced to lie side by side by virtue of the interaction of the polar group with water, and thus interactions between different chains must occur. Most of the evidence suggests that, when a solid phase results in these systems, the nonspecific chain packing mode (hexagonal chain packing) is preferred. In fact, for all of the phospholipids studied thus far, clearcut evidence of specific chain-chain interaction in molecules having both unsaturated and saturated chains has never been observed. However, for mixed chain triacylglycerols, evidence of specific chain-chain interactions (beta' and even beta) has been found and some suggestions have been given as to how this might occur through chain segregation mechanisms in the neat state. The literature suggests that further work needs to be done on the interaction of different chains that are covalently linked to the same molecule. Such studies will lead to a better understanding of the structure of lipid bilayers, membranes, lipoproteins, and lipid deposits.},

Track-etch membranes offer distinct advantages over conventional membranes due to their precisely determined structure. Their pore size, shape and density can be varied in a controllable manner so that a membrane with the required transport and retention characteristics can be produced. The use of heavy ion accelerators made it possible to vary LET of track-forming particles, angle distribution of pore channels and pore lengths. So far the track formation and etching process has been studied in much detail for several polymeric materials. Today we understand determining factors and have numerous empirical data enabling us to manufacture any particular product based on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) or polycarbonate (PC) films. Pore shape can be made cylindrical, conical, funnel-like, or cigar-like at will. A number of modification methods has been developed for creating TMs with special properties and functions. Applications of “conventional” track membranes can be categorized into three groups: process filtration, cell culture, and laboratory filtration. The use in biology stands out among other areas. Nuclear track pores find diverse applications as model systems and as templates for the synthesis of micro- and nanostructures.},

Effects of variations in membrane formation conditions which can be calculated using the model of diffusive mass transport in thin films of polymeric solutions in combination with phase separation in phase-inversion membranes, completely support the mechanism as proposed.},

Nanocomposite films created for this study comprise NaA zeolite nanoparticles dispersed within 50–200nm thick polyamide films. Hand-cast pure polyamide membranes exhibit surface morphologies characteristic of commercial polyamide RO membranes, whereas nanocomposite membranes have measurably smoother and more hydrophilic, negatively charged surfaces. At the highest nanoparticle loadings tested, hand-cast nanocomposite film morphology is visibly different and pure water permeability is nearly double that of hand-cast polyamide membranes with equivalent solute rejections. Comparison of membranes formed using pore-filled and pore-opened zeolites suggest nanoparticle pores play an active role in water permeation and solute rejection. The best performing nanocomposite membranes exhibit permeability and rejection characteristics comparable to commercial RO membranes. As a concept, thin film nanocomposite membrane technology may offer new degrees of freedom in tailoring RO membrane separation performance and material properties.},

Long alkanes, such as tetradecane and hexadecane, increase the transition temperature of dimyristoyl phosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylcholine, while the X-ray data indicate that these long alkanes align parallel to the lipid acyl chains. In contrast, shorter alkanes, such as hexane and octane, decrease and broaden the thermal transition and electron density profiles show that these alkanes increase bilayer width by partitioning between the apposing monolayers of the bilayer.

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are well established for the study of biomolecular systems. Within these simulations, energy functions known as force fields are used to determine the forces acting on atoms and molecules. While these force fields have been very successful, they contain a number of approximations, included to overcome limitations in computing power. One of the most important of these approximations is the omission of polarizability, the process by which the charge distribution in a molecule changes in response to its environment. Since polarizability is known to be important in many biochemical situations, and since advances in computer hardware have reduced the need for approximations within force fields, there is major interest in the use of force fields that include an explicit representation of polarizability. As such, a number of polarizable force fields have been under development: these have been largely experimental, and their use restricted to specialized researchers. This situation is now changing. Parameters for fully optimized polarizable force fields are being published, and associated code incorporated into standard simulation software. Simulations on the hundred-nanosecond timescale are being reported, and are now within reach of all simulation scientists. In this overview, I examine the polarizable force fields available for the simulation of biomolecules, the systems to which they have been applied, and the benefits and challenges that polarizability can bring. In considering future directions for development of polarizable force fields, I examine lessons learnt from non-polarizable force fields, and highlight issues that remain to be addressed.

	abstract = {We report a molecular dynamics simulation demonstrating that a columnar liquid crystal, commonly formed by disc-shaped molecules, can be formed by identical particles interacting via a spherically symmetric potential. Upon isochoric cooling from a low-density isotropic liquid state the simulated system performed a weak first order phase transition which produced a liquid crystal phase composed of parallel particle columns arranged in a hexagonal pattern in the plane perpendicular to the column axis. The particles within columns formed a liquid structure and demonstrated a significant intracolumn diffusion. Further cooling resulted in another first-order transition whereby the column structure became periodically ordered in three dimensions transforming the liquid-crystal phase into a crystal. This result is the first observation of a liquid crystal formation in a simple one-component system of particles. Its conceptual significance is in that it demonstrated that liquid crystals that have so far only been produced in systems of anisometric molecules, can also be formed by mesoscopic soft-matter and colloidal systems of spherical particles with appropriately tuned interatomic potential.},

	abstract = {Many soft-matter and biophysical systems are composed of monomers that reversibly assemble into rod-like aggregates. The aggregates can then order into liquid-crystal phases if the density is high enough, and liquid-crystal ordering promotes increased growth of aggregates. Systems that display coupled aggregation and liquid-crystal ordering include wormlike micelles, chromonic liquid crystals, DNA and RNA, and protein polymers and fibrils. Coarse-grained molecular models that capture key features of coupled aggregation and liquid-crystal ordering common to many different systems are lacking; in particular, the roles of monomer aspect ratio and aggregate flexibility in controlling the phase behavior are not well understood. Here we study a minimal system of sticky cylinders using Monte Carlo simulations and analytic theory. Cylindrical monomers interact primarily by hard-core interactions but can stack and bind end to end. We present results for several different cylinder aspect ratios and a range of end-to-end binding energies. The phase diagrams are qualitatively similar to those of chromonic liquid crystals, with an isotropic-nematic-columnar triple point. The location of the triple point is sensitive to the monomer aspect ratio. We find that the aggregate persistence length varies with temperature in a way that is controlled by the interaction potential; this suggests that the form of the interaction potential affects the phase behavior of the system. Our analytic theory shows improvement compared to previous theory in quantitatively predicting the I–N transition for relatively stiff aggregates, but requires a better treatment of aggregate flexibility.},

It is demonstrated that the finite-size, slow relaxation and discretization errors, which were ignored in previous studies, may cause significant underestimation of tortuosity. The simple tortuosity calculation method proposed here eliminates the need for using complicated, weighted averages. The numerical results presented here are in good agreement with an empirical relation between tortuosity (T) and porosity (ϕ) given by T−1∝lnϕ, that was found by others experimentally in granule packings and sediments. This relation can be also written as T−1∝RS∕ϕ with R and S denoting the hydraulic radius of granules and the specific surface area, respectively. Applicability of these relations appears to be restricted to porous systems of randomly distributed obstacles of equal shape and size.},

	abstract = {The properties of water under confinement are of practical and fundamental interest. In this work, we study the properties of water in the self-assembled lyotropic phases of Gemini surfactants with a focus on testing the standard analysis of quasi-elastic neutron scattering (QENS) experiments. In QENS experiments, the dynamic structure factor is measured and fit to models to extract the translational diffusion constant, DT, and rotational relaxation time, τR. We test this procedure by using simulation results for the dynamic structure factor, extracting the dynamic parameters from the fit as is typically done in experiments, and comparing the values to those directly measured in the simulations. We find that the de-coupling approximation, where the intermediate scattering function is assumed to be a product of translational and rotational contributions, is quite accurate. The jump-diffusion and isotropic rotation models, however, are not accurate when the degree of confinement is high. In particular, the exponential approximations for the intermediate scattering function fail for highly confined water and the values of DT and τR can differ from the measured value by as much as a factor of two. Other models have more fit parameters, however, and with the range of energies and wave-vectors accessible to QENS, the typical analysis appears to be the best choice. In the most confined lamellar phase, the dynamics are sufficiently slow that QENS does not access a large enough time scale.},

	abstract = {The dynamics of confined water is of fundamental and long-standing interest. In technologically important forms of confinement, such as proton-exchange membranes, electrostatic interactions with the confining matrix and counterions play significant roles on the properties of water. There has been recent interest on the dynamics of water confined to the lyotropic liquid crystalline (LLC) morphologies of Gemini dicarboxylate surfactants. These systems are exciting because the nature of confinement, for example, size and curvature of channels and surface functionality is dictated by the chemistry of the self-assembling surfactant molecules. Quasielastic neutron scattering experiments have shown an interesting dependence of the water self-diffusion constant, Dα, on the identity (denoted α) of the counterion: at high hydration, the magnitude of the water self-diffusion constant is in the order DTMA {\textless} DNa {\textless} DK, where TMA, Na, and K refer to tetramethyl ammonium, sodium, and potassium counterions, respectively. This sequence is similar to what is seen in bulk electrolyte solutions. At low hydrations, however, the order of water self-diffusion is different, that is, DNa {\textless} DTMA {\textless} DK. In this work, we present molecular dynamics simulations for the dynamics of water in the LLC phases of dicarboxylate Gemini surfactants. The simulations reproduce the trends seen in experiments. From an analysis of the trajectories, we hypothesize that two competing factors play a role: the volume accessible to the water molecules and the correlations between the water and the counterion. The excluded volume effect is the largest with TMA+, and the electrostatic correlation is the strongest with Na+. The observed trend is a result of which of these two effects is dominant at a given water to surfactant ratio.},

The as-grown crystals have chains perpendicular to the lamellar surface, but around 90 °C they start tilting relative to the layer normal. The tilt increases gradually to reach 35° just below melting point. The end-labeled alkane allows independent IR probing of molecular disorder at the deuterated surface layer and in the hydrogenous interior of the crystals. The initially small splitting of the CD2 bending mode doublet and the presence of a singlet component indicated a rough surface in as-grown crystals, with considerable translational disorder. The increase in splitting and decrease in absorbance of the singlet which occur on annealing at progressively higher temperatures showed a steady improvement in translational surface order, concomitant with an increase in chain tilt angle. Thus, it is concluded that the absence of tilt in as-grown crystals is not due to high surface order, as in the case of shorter odd n-alkanes, but rather to high nonequilibrium surface disorder with chain ends or folds protruding out of or sunk beneath the surface. It is also concluded that chain tilt only becomes necessary as the crystal surface becomes translationally more ordered and the crystal−amorphous interface sharpens. IR also demonstrated the reversible increase in conformational disorder in the surface layer with increasing temperature and an almost negligible increase in the crystal interior. The gradual change in tilt angle and the existence of noncrystallographic basal planes is interpreted in terms of translational molecular disorder at the surface. The increased central SAXS scatter during the tilting process indicates the creation of voids associated with ridge formation and corrugation of the lamellae.},

We calculate the relationships between the stability of the complexes, the charge transfer between monomers and the properties of the intermolecular bonds including hydrogen bonds and other bonds that do not involve hydrogen atoms. DFT-SAPT calculations were also performed to obtain the participation of the different types of energy and so the resulting physical effects. The results show that the presence of hydrogen bonds is the main stabilizing factor for dimers: the higher number and strength, the lower the dimer energy. The contribution of stacking to the stabilization is related to the strength and number of bonds between non-hydrogen atoms and quantified by the contribution of the dispersion terms to the interaction energy. Dimers I and II are mainly stabilized due to hydrogen bonds whereas dimer III is mainly stabilized by stacking interactions.},

Since there were no experimental data available on internal rotations in EB and BA, barriers to rotation in benzaldehyde and three similar compounds were calculated as benchmarks and compared with experimental data. Calculated barriers in the benzaldehydes were within 1 kcal/mol of the experimental values. The tentative conclusion from the rotation barrier results on model compounds is that PET-type polymers made from high-rotation-barrier monomers like ortho-hydroxy-terephthalic acid should have larger internal barriers to rotation than unsubstituted PET, leading to more rigid polymers with higher glass transition temperatures, Tg, and an altered degree of crystallinity. We found an unexpectedly low barrier to rotation of 2.3 kcal/mol for ortho XCH3, compared to about 5 kcal/ mol for ortho XH. Based on these model studies, we would expect that a PET-type polymer made from ortho-methyl substituted terephthalate would be more flexible, would have a lower glass transition temperature and different degree of crystallinity with accompanying change in void space.},

	abstract = {It is well-known that some aromatic anions have the ability to induce viscoelastic transformation in aqueous solutions of cationic surfactants even at added salt concentrations as low as 10−20 mM. This behavior is associated with the formation of an entangled network of elongated micelles. However, the effect of aromatic ring substituents on the anion's ability to promote rapid micelle growth is not well-understood. We have performed ab initio calculations of the carbonyl group rotation barriers in a series of substituted benzoate and naphthoate anions at the MP2/STO-3G level of theory. It was found that aromatic carboxylates, known to be particularly effective in causing sphere−rod transition in cationic micelles, preferably adopt conformations with the COO- group in the same plane as the ring(s). This structural preference can be attributed to either intramolecular hydrogen bonding (o-hydroxyl derivatives) or π-conjugation effects (m- and p-halogenated derivatives). In the former case the barrier to rotation is 40−50 kcal/mol, whereas in the latter case the threshold value is around 3.0 kcal/mol. Propensity for the planar conformation correlates with a greater depth of counterion penetration into the micelle surface, as inferred from NMR experiments, compared to the anions with less hindered carbonyl rotation. This points to favorable hydrophobic interactions between the surfactant methylene groups and the aromatic ring(s) of the anion as a possible explanation for the rapid growth of cationic micelles observed upon addition of certain aromatic carboxylates.},

	abstract = {ConspectusThe carbonyl group holds a prominent position in chemistry and biology not only because it allows diverse transformations but also because it supports key intermolecular interactions, including hydrogen bonding. More recently, carbonyl groups have been found to interact with a variety of nucleophiles, including other carbonyl groups, in what we have termed an n→π* interaction. In an n→π* interaction, a nucleophile donates lone-pair (n) electron density into the empty π* orbital of a nearby carbonyl group. Mixing of these orbitals releases energy, resulting in an attractive interaction. Hints of such interactions were evident in small-molecule crystal structures as early as the 1970s, but not until 2001 was the role of such interactions articulated clearly.These non-covalent interactions were first discovered during investigations into the thermostability of the proline-rich protein collagen, which achieves a robust structure despite a relatively low potential for hydrogen bonding. It was found that by modulating the distance between two carbonyl groups in the peptide backbone, one could alter the conformational preferences of a peptide bond to proline. Specifically, only the trans conformation of a peptide bond to proline allows for an attractive interaction with an adjacent carbonyl group, so when one increases the proximity of the two carbonyl groups, one enhances their interaction and promotes the trans conformation of the peptide bond, which increases the thermostability of collagen.More recently, attention has been paid to the nature of these interactions. Some have argued that rather than resulting from electron donation, carbonyl interactions are a particular example of dipolar interactions that are well-approximated by classical mechanics. However, experimental evidence has demonstrated otherwise. Numerous examples now exist where an increase in the dipole moment of a carbonyl group decreases the strength of its interactions with other carbonyl groups, demonstrating unequivocally that a dipolar mechanism is insufficient to describe these interactions. Rather, these interactions have important quantum-mechanical character that can be evaluated through careful experimental analysis and judicious use of computation.Although individual n→π* interactions are relatively weak (∼0.3–0.7 kcal/mol), the ubiquity of carbonyl groups across chemistry and biology gives the n→π* interaction broad impact. In particular, the n→π* interaction is likely to play an important role in dictating protein structure. Indeed, bioinformatics analysis suggests that approximately one-third of residues in folded proteins satisfy the geometric requirements to engage in an n→π* interaction, which is likely to be of particular importance for the α-helix. Other carbonyl-dense polymeric materials like polyesters and peptoids are also influenced by n→π* interactions, as are a variety of small molecules, some with particular medicinal importance. Research will continue to identify molecules whose conformation and activity are affected by the n→π* interaction and will clarify their specific contributions to the structures of biomacromolecules.},

Three common interaction motifs are observed in crystal structures: (a) a slightly sheared antiparallel motif (650 instances) involving a pair of short C⋯O interactions, together with (b) a perpendicular motif (116 instances) and (c) a highly sheared parallel motif (130 instances), which both involve a single short C⋯O interaction. Together, these motifs account for 945 (71\%) of the observed interactions. Ab-initio-based molecular-orbital calculations (6-31G** basis sets), using intermolecular perturbation theory (IMPT) applied to a bis-propanone dimer model, yield an attractive interaction energy of −22.3 kJ mol−1 for a perfect rectangular antiparallel dimer having both d(C⋯O) = 3.02 Å and attractive energies {\textless} −20 kJ mol−1 over the d(C⋯O) range 2.92–3.32 Å. These energies are comparable to those of medium-strength hydrogen bonds. The IMPT calculations indicate a slight shearing of the antiparallel motif with increasing d(C⋯O). For the perpendicular motif, IMPT yields an attractive interaction energy of −7.6 kJ mol−1, comparable in strength to a C—H⋯O hydrogen bond and with the single d(C⋯O) again at 3.02 Å.},

	abstract = {A huge potential to obtain clean energy exists from mixing water streams with different salt concentrations. Two membrane-based energy conversion techniques are evaluated: pressure-retarded osmosis and reverse electrodialysis. From the literature, a comparison is not possible since the reported performances are not comparable. A method was developed which allows for a comparison of both techniques at equal conditions, with respect to power density and energy recovery. Based on the results from the model calculations, each technique has its own field of application. Pressure-retarded osmosis seems to be more attractive for power generation using concentrated saline brines because of the higher power density combined with higher energy recovery. Reverse electrodialysis seems to be more attractive for power generation using seawater and river water. These conclusions are valid for present and latent performances of both techniques. According to the model, the potential performances of both techniques are much better than the current performances. In order to achieve these potential performances, the development of pressure-retarded osmosis must focus on membrane characteristics, i.e. increasing the water permeability of the membrane skin and optimization of the porous support. The development of reverse electrodialysis, however, must focus on system characteristics, i.e. optimization of the internal resistance, which is mainly determined by the width of the spacers.},

	abstract = {We present here equilibrium molecular dynamics simulation results for self-diffusion coefficients, shear viscosity, and electrical conductivity in a model ionic liquid (1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride) at different temperatures. The Green−Kubo relations were employed to evaluate the transport coefficients. When compared with available experimental data, the model underestimates the conductivity and self-diffusion, whereas the viscosity is overpredicted, showing only a semiquantitative agreement with experimental data. These discrepancies are explained on the basis of the rigidity and lack of polarizability of the model. Despite this, the experimental trends with temperature are remarkably well reproduced, with a good agreement on the activation energies when available. No significant deviations from the Nernst−Einstein relation can be assessed on the basis of the statistical uncertainty of the simulations, although the comparison between the electric current and the velocity autocorrelation functions suggests some degree of cross-correlation among ions in a short time scale. The simulations reproduce remarkably well the slope of the Walden plots obtained from experimental data of 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride, confirming that temperature does not alter appreciably the extent of ion pairing.},

	abstract = {The benzene dimer is the simplest prototype of π−π interactions and has been used to understand the fundamental physics of these interactions as they are observed in more complex systems. In biological systems, however, aromatic rings are rarely found in isolated pairs; thus, it is important to understand whether aromatic pairs remain a good model of π−π interactions in clusters. In this study, ab initio methods are used to compute the binding energies of several benzene trimers and tetramers, most of them in 1D stacked configurations. The two-body terms change only slightly relative to the dimer, and except for the cyclic trimer, the three- and four-body terms are negligible. This indicates that aromatic clusters do not feature any large nonadditive effects in their binding energies, and polarization effects in benzene clusters do not greatly change the binding that would be anticipated from unperturbed benzene−benzene interactions, at least for the 1D stacked systems considered. Three-body effects are larger for the cyclic trimer, but for all systems considered, the computed binding energies are within 10\% of what would be estimated from benzene dimer energies at the same geometries.},

What is the `phase' in crystallography? What is `the problem'? How can we overcome the problem? The paper will emphasize that the phase values can only be discovered through some prior knowledge of the structure. The paper will canter through direct methods, isomorphous replacement, anomalous scattering and molecular replacement. As phasing is the most acronymic realm of crystallography, MR, SIR, SIRAS, MIR, MIRAS, MAD and SAD will be expanded and explained in part. Along the way, we will meet some of the heroes of protein crystallography such as Perutz, Kendrew, Crick, Rossmann and Blow who established many of the phasing methods in the UK. It is inevitable that some basic mathematics is encountered, but this will be done as gently as possible.},

Very large osmotic pressures generated by the highly soluble ammonium bicarbonate draw solution yield high water fluxes and can result in very high feed water recoveries. Upon moderate heating, ammonium bicarbonate decomposes into ammonia and carbon dioxide gases that can be separated and recycled as draw solutes, leaving the fresh product water. Experiments with a laboratory-scale FO unit utilizing a flat sheet cellulose tri-acetate membrane demonstrated high product water flux and relatively high salt rejection. The results further revealed that reverse osmosis (RO) membranes are not suitable for the FO process because of relatively low product water fluxes attributed to severe internal concentration polarization in the porous support and fabric layers of the RO membrane.},

The effect of MWCNT on the chlorine resistance, antifouling and desalination performances of the nanocomposite membranes were studied. We found that a suitable amount of MWCNT in PA, 15.5 wt.\%, not only improves the membrane performance in terms of flow and antifouling, but also inhibits the chlorine degradation on these membranes.

	abstract = {Accurately calculating rate constants of macroscopic chemical processes from molecular dynamics simulations is a long-sought but elusive goal. The problem is particularly relevant for processes occurring in biological systems, as is the case for ligand–protein and ligand–membrane interactions. Several formalisms to determine rate constants from easily accessible free-energy profiles [ΔGo(z)] of a molecule along a coordinate of interest have been proposed. However, their applicability for molecular interactions in condensed media has not been critically evaluated or validated. This work presents such evaluation and validation and introduces improved methodology. As a case study, we have characterized quantitatively the rate of translocation of cholesterol across 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine bilayers. Translocation across lipid bilayers is the rate-limiting step in the permeation of most drugs through biomembranes. We use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations and different kinetic formalisms to calculate this rate constant. A self-consistent test of the applicability of various available formalisms is provided by comparing their predictions with the translocation rates obtained from actual events observed in long unrestrained simulations. To this effect, a novel procedure was used to obtain the effective rate constant, based on an analysis of time intervals between transitions among different states along the reaction coordinate. While most tested formalisms lead to results in reasonable agreement (within a factor of 5) with this effective rate constant, the most adequate one is based on the explicit relaxation frequencies from the transition state in the forward and backward directions along the reaction coordinate.},

	abstract = {We develop novel parallel algorithms that allow molecular dynamics simulations in which byproduct molecules are created and removed because of the chemical reactions during the molecular dynamics simulation. To prevent large increases in the potential energy, we introduce the byproduct molecules smoothly by changing the non-bonded interactions gradually. To simulate complete equilibrium reactions, we allow the byproduct molecules attack and destroy created bonds. Modeling of such reactions are, for instance, important to study the pore formation due to the presence of e.g. water molecules or development of polymer morphology during the process of splitting off byproduct molecules. Another concept that could be studied is the degradation of polymeric materials, a very important topic in a recycling of polymer waste. We illustrate the method by simulating the polymerization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) at the coarse-grained level as an example of a polycondensation reaction with water as a byproduct. The algorithms are implemented in a publicly available software package and are easily accessible using a domain-specific language that describes chemical reactions in an input configuration file. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Many popular methods for the calculation of chemical potentials rely on the insertion of test particles into the target system. In the case of liquids and liquid mixtures, this procedure increases in difficulty upon increasing density or concentration, and the use of sophisticated enhanced sampling techniques becomes inevitable. In this work, we propose an alternative strategy, spatially resolved thermodynamic integration, or SPARTIAN for short. Here, molecules are described with atomistic resolution in a simulation subregion and as ideal gas particles in a larger reservoir. All molecules are free to diffuse between subdomains adapting their resolution on the fly. To enforce a uniform density profile across the simulation box, a single-molecule external potential is computed, applied, and identified with the difference in chemical potential between the two resolutions. Since the reservoir is represented as an ideal gas bath, this difference exactly amounts to the excess chemical potential of the target system. The present approach surpasses the high density/concentration limitation of particle insertion methods because the ideal gas molecules entering the target system region spontaneously adapt to the local environment. The ideal gas representation contributes negligibly to the computational cost of the simulation, thus allowing one to make use of large reservoirs at minimal expenses. The method has been validated by computing excess chemical potentials for pure Lennard-Jones liquids and mixtures, SPC and SPC/E liquid water, and aqueous solutions of sodium chloride. The reported results well reproduce literature data for these systems.},

	abstract = {The balance of normal and radial (lateral) diﬀusion of oxygen in phospholipid mem-branes is critical for biological function. Based on the Smoluchowski equation for the inhomogeneous solubility-diﬀusion model, Bayesian analysis (BA) can be applied to molecular dynamics trajectories of oxygen to extract the free energy, and the normal and radial diﬀusion proﬁles. This paper derives a theoretical formalism to convert these proﬁles into characteristic times and lengths associated with entering, escaping, or completely crossing the membrane. The formalism computes mean ﬁrst passage times and holds for any process described by rate equations between discrete states. BA of simulations of eight model membranes with varying lipid composition and temperature indicate that oxygen travels 3 to 5 times further in the radial than in the normal direction when crossing the membrane in a time of 15 to 32 ns, thereby conﬁrming the anisotropy of passive oxygen transport in membranes. Moreover, the preceding times and distances estimated from the BA are compared to the aggregate of 280 membrane exits explicitly observed in the trajectories. BA predictions for the distances of oxygen radial diﬀusion within the membrane are statistically indistinguishable from the corresponding simulation values, yet BA oxygen exit times from the membrane interior are approximately 20\% shorter than the simulation values, averaged over seven systems. The comparison supports the BA approach and, therefore, the applicability of the Smoluchowski equation to membrane diﬀusion. Given the shorter trajectories required for the BA, these results validate the BA as a computationally attractive alternative to direct observation of exits when estimating characteristic times and radial distances. The eﬀect of collective membrane undulations on the BA is also discussed.},

	abstract = {The transport of small molecules across a phospholipid membrane is studied by molecular dynamics simulations. The effects of size, hydrophobicity, and asphericity of the penetrants on the permeation process are investigated. For this purpose, permeability coefficients of oxygen and ammonia are computed using an inhomogeneous solubility−diffusion model and compared to the previously computed results of the permeation of water. Furthermore, solubility and diffusion data are computed for a series of Lennard-Jones particles that differ in size and shape. The results are discussed within the framework of the four-region model and are especially related to the free volume characteristics of the membrane. It is concluded that the free energy of solvation mainly determines the shape of the permeation resistance profile. For hydrophobic particles the membrane interior will act as a trap instead of a barrier. Moderately hydrophilic and hydrophilic penetrants experience the largest resistance to permeation in the dense part of the lipid tail region. This region is therefore most important in discriminating between various penetrants.},

	abstract = {A Bayesian-based methodology is developed to estimate diffusion tensors from molecular dynamics simulations of permeants in anisotropic media, and is applied to oxygen in lipid bilayers. By a separation of variables in the Smoluchowski diffusion equation, the multidimensional diffusion is reduced to coupled one-dimensional diffusion problems that are treated by discretization. The resulting diffusivity profiles characterize the membrane transport dynamics as a function of the position across the membrane, discriminating between diffusion normal and parallel to the membrane. The methodology is first validated with neat water, neat hexadecane, and a hexadecane slab surrounded by water, the latter being a simple model for a lipid membrane. Next, a bilayer consisting of pure 1-palmitoyl 2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC), and a bilayer mimicking the lipid composition of the inner mitochondrial membrane, including cardiolipin, are investigated. We analyze the detailed time evolution of oxygen molecules, in terms of both normal diffusion through and radial diffusion inside the membrane. Diffusion is fast in the more loosely packed interleaflet region, and anisotropic, with oxygen spreading more rapidly in the membrane plane than normal to it. Visualization of the propagator shows that oxygen enters the membrane rapidly, reaching its thermodynamically favored center in about 1 ns, despite the free energy barrier at the headgroup region. Oxygen transport is quantified by computing the oxygen permeability of the membranes and the average radial diffusivity, which confirm the anisotropy of the diffusion. The position-dependent diffusion constants and free energies are used to construct compartmental models and test assumptions used in estimating permeability, including Overton’s rule. In particular, a hexadecane slab surrounded by water is found to be a poor model of oxygen transport in membranes because the relevant energy barriers differ substantially.},

Fifty years after Kramers' seminal paper on thermally activated barrier crossing, the authors report, extend, and interpret much of our current understanding relating to theories of noise-activated escape, for which many of the notable contributions are originating from the communities both of physics and of physical chemistry. Theoretical as well as numerical approaches are discussed for single- and many-dimensional metastable systems (including fields) in gases and condensed phases. The role of many-dimensional transition-state theory is contrasted with Kramers' reaction-rate theory for moderate-to-strong friction; the authors emphasize the physical situation and the close connection between unimolecular rate theory and Kramers' work for weakly damped systems. The rate theory accounting for memory friction is presented, together with a unifying theoretical approach which covers the whole regime of weak-to-moderate-to-strong friction on the same basis (turnover theory). The peculiarities of noise-activated escape in a variety of physically different metastable potential configurations is elucidated in terms of the mean-first-passage-time technique. Moreover, the role and the complexity of escape in driven systems exhibiting possibly multiple, metastable stationary nonequilibrium states is identified. At lower temperatures, quantum tunneling effects start to dominate the rate mechanism. The early quantum approaches as well as the latest quantum versions of Kramers' theory are discussed, thereby providing a description of dissipative escape events at all temperatures. In addition, an attempt is made to discuss prominent experimental work as it relates to Kramers' reaction-rate theory and to indicate the most important areas for future research in theory and experiment.},

There have been multiple examples where this approach has been adapted for use in antireflection and antiglare technologies with the fabrication of artificial moth-eye surfaces. In this work, the suppression of iridescence caused by the diffraction of light from such artificial regular moth-eye arrays at high angles of incidence is achieved with the use of a new tiled domain design, inspired by the arrangement of features on natural moth-eye surfaces. This bio-mimetic pillar architecture contains high optical rotational symmetry and can achieve high levels of diffraction order power reduction. For example, a tiled design fabricated in silicon and consisting of domains with 9 different orientations of the traditional hexagonal array exhibited a {\textasciitilde}96\% reduction in the intensity of the −1 diffraction order. It is suggested natural moth-eye surfaces have evolved a tiled domain structure as it confers efficient antireflection whilst avoiding problems with high angle diffraction. This combination of antireflection and stealth properties increases chances of survival by reducing the risk of the insect being spotted by a predator. Furthermore, the tiled domain design could lead to more effective artificial moth-eye arrays for antiglare and stealth applications.},

Commercial reverse osmosis processes for water desalination use membranes made by the polymerization of polyamide at the oil/water interface. Chowdhury et al. show that thinner, smoother membranes can be made with an electrospray technique. Using high voltage, the two precursors are finely sprayed onto a substrate and polymerize on contact. The composition of the resulting membrane can be tuned on the basis of the proportion of the two components. At optimum conditions, the membranes appear to be better at desalination than current commercial reverse osmosis membranes.
Science, this issue p. 682
Polyamide thickness and roughness have been identified as critical properties that affect thin-film composite membrane performance for reverse osmosis. Conventional formation methodologies lack the ability to control these properties independently with high resolution or precision. An additive approach is presented that uses electrospraying to deposit monomers directly onto a substrate, where they react to form polyamide. The small droplet size coupled with low monomer concentrations result in polyamide films that are smoother and thinner than conventional polyamides, while the additive nature of the approach allows for control of thickness and roughness. Polyamide films are formed with a thickness that is controllable down to 4-nanometer increments and a roughness as low as 2 nanometers while still exhibiting good permselectivity relative to a commercial benchmarking membrane.
Electrospraying precursors leads to a smoother, more efficient polyamide water purification membrane.

First, tools to assess the impact of these pollutants on aquatic life and human health must be further developed and refined. Second, cost-effective and appropriate remediation and water-treatment technologies must be explored and implemented. Third, usage and disposal strategies, coupled with the search for environmentally more benign products and processes, should aim to minimize introduction of critical pollutants into the aquatic environment.},

This paper deals with the investigation on the rejection of low molecular weight organic compounds by ULPRO membrane. Laboratory scale experiments were carried out at a pressure of 3kg/cm2 with a feed flow rate of 1.20l/min. The rejection of undissociated organic compounds did not show a close relationship with the feed pH. The percentage removal of undissociated organic compounds increased linearly with the molecular weight as well as with the molecular width. The removal efficiency can be predicted by these relationships. But neither molecular weight nor molecular width can be considered as an absolute factor for rejection. The feed pH also influenced the removal efficiency of dissociated organic compounds. The efficiency decreased linearly with the increase in the dissociation constant.},

Monovalent organosulfonate anions of various sizes were completely exchanged as the counterion at the pore walls to explore the impact of anion size on uncharged molecular solute rejection and water permeance. It was found that larger organosulfonate anions associated at the pore walls induced a higher rejection of uncharged solutes and a lower water permeance. The change in selectivity of the nanopores was described quantitatively through the calculation of the effective pore radius. The effective pore radius in these modified membranes was found to vary from 0.9±0.2 to 0.55±0.08nm depending on the resident organosulfonate counterion, demonstrating sub-1-nm resolution in pore size manipulation. An empirical model was used to demonstrate that physicochemical properties (molecular volume and hydrophobicity) of the resident counterion correlate with the observed solute rejection, suggesting that the counterion can be chosen to target a desired membrane performance. The ability to manipulate uniform, nm-sized pores with sub-1-nm resolution via simple anion-exchange offers a new avenue to tailor nanofiltration membrane performance.},

	abstract = {A polymeric membrane material for efficient water desalination based on a cross-linked type I bicontinuous cubic (QI) lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) assembly is described. This ordered, nanoporous, polymer material is formed by the self-assembly of a cross-linkable gemini amphiphile in water and contains interpenetrating organic networks separated from one another by a continuous, ultrathin water layer surface (ca. 0.75 nm gap spacing) with overall cubic symmetry. Supported membranes of this material are produced by hot-pressing the initial LLC monomer gel at high pressure through a commercial microporous hydrophilic membrane support at 70 °C and then radically photocross-linking the infused QI monomer phase. In stirred dead-end water filtration tests, the resulting 40-μm thick, optically transparent, supported LLC membranes exhibit 95−99.9\% rejection of dissolved salt ions, neutral molecules and macromolecules, and molecular ions in the 0.64−1.2 nm size range in a single pass. This rejection performance is slightly better than that of a commercial reverse osmosis (RO) membrane for the same solutes under the same test conditions, and significantly better than that of a commercial porous nanofiltration membrane. The LLC polymer material also exhibits a thickness- and pressure-normalized water permeability that is similar to or just slightly lower than the dense active layer materials used in current RO membranes. It is believed that the 3-D interconnected water manifold system in the cross-linked QI-phase material allows small water molecules (0.27 nm kinetic diameter) to pass through with good efficiency, while effectively rejecting dissolved solutes close in size to, or larger than, the about 0.75 nm water layer gap spacing.},

	abstract = {The chemical composition of small organic molecules is often very similar to amino acid side chains or the bases in nucleic acids, and hence there is no a priori reason why a molecular mechanics force field could not describe both organic liquids and biomolecules with a single parameter set. Here, we devise a benchmark for force fields in order to test the ability of existing force fields to reproduce some key properties of organic liquids, namely, the density, enthalpy of vaporization, the surface tension, the heat capacity at constant volume and pressure, the isothermal compressibility, the volumetric expansion coefficient, and the static dielectric constant. Well over 1200 experimental measurements were used for comparison to the simulations of 146 organic liquids. Novel polynomial interpolations of the dielectric constant (32 molecules), heat capacity at constant pressure (three molecules), and the isothermal compressibility (53 molecules) as a function of the temperature have been made, based on experimental data, in order to be able to compare simulation results to them. To compute the heat capacities, we applied the two phase thermodynamics method (Lin et al. J. Chem. Phys.2003, 119, 11792), which allows one to compute thermodynamic properties on the basis of the density of states as derived from the velocity autocorrelation function. The method is implemented in a new utility within the GROMACS molecular simulation package, named g\_dos, and a detailed exposé of the underlying equations is presented. The purpose of this work is to establish the state of the art of two popular force fields, OPLS/AA (all-atom optimized potential for liquid simulation) and GAFF (generalized Amber force field), to find common bottlenecks, i.e., particularly difficult molecules, and to serve as a reference point for future force field development. To make for a fair playing field, all molecules were evaluated with the same parameter settings, such as thermostats and barostats, treatment of electrostatic interactions, and system size (1000 molecules). The densities and enthalpy of vaporization from an independent data set based on simulations using the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF) presented by Vanommeslaeghe et al. (J. Comput. Chem.2010, 31, 671) are included for comparison. We find that, overall, the OPLS/AA force field performs somewhat better than GAFF, but there are significant issues with reproduction of the surface tension and dielectric constants for both force fields.},

In this work, we study the dynamics of water in gemini surfactant-based lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) using molecular dynamics simulations. These systems have well characterized morphologies, for example, hexagonal, gyroid, and lamellar, and the surfaces of the confining regions can be controlled by modifying the headgroup of the surfactants. This allows one to study the effect of topology, functionalization, and interfacial curvature on the dynamics of confined water. Through analysis of the translational diffusion and rotational relaxation, we conclude that the hydration level and resulting confinement length scale is the predominate determiner of the rates of water dynamics, and other effects, namely, surface functionality and curvature, are largely secondary. This novel analysis of the water dynamics in these LLC systems provides an important comparison for previous studies of water dynamics in lipid bilayers and reverse micelles.},

	abstract = {Noncovalent interactions involving aromatic rings such as π-stacking, cation/π, and anion/π interactions are central to many areas of modern chemistry. Decades of experimental studies have provided key insights into the impact of substituents on these interactions, leading to the development of simple intuitive models. However, gas-phase computational studies have raised some doubts about the physical underpinnings of these widespread models. In this Account we review our recent efforts to unravel the origin of substituent effects in π-stacking and ion/π interactions through computational studies of model noncovalent dimers.First, however, we dispel the notion that so-called aromatic interactions depend on the aromaticity of the interacting rings by studying model π-stacked dimers in which the aromaticity of one of the monomers can be “switched off”. Somewhat surprisingly, the results show that not only is aromaticity unnecessary for π-stacking interactions, but it actually hinders these interactions to some extent. Consequently, when thinking about π-stacking interactions, researchers should consider broader classes of planar molecules, not just aromatic systems.Conventional models maintain that substituent effects in π-stacking interactions result from changes in the aryl π-system. This view suggests that π-stacking interactions are maximized when one ring is substituted with electron-withdrawing groups and the other with electron donors. In contrast to these prevailing models, we have shown that substituent effects in π-stacking interactions can be described in terms of direct, local interactions between the substituents and the nearby vertex of the other arene. As a result, in polysubstituted π-stacked dimers the substituents operate independently unless they are in each other’s local environment. This means that in π-stacked dimers in which one arene is substituted with electron donors and the other with electron acceptors the interactions will be enhanced only to the extent provided by each substituent on its own, unless the substituents on opposing rings are in close proximity. Overall, this local, direct interaction model predicts that substituent effects in π-stacking interactions will be additive and transferable and will also depend on the relative position of substituents on opposing rings.For cation/π and anion/π interactions, similar π-resonance-based models pervade the literature. Again, computational results indicate that substituent effects in model ion/π complexes can be described primarily in terms of direct interactions between the ion and the substituent. Changes in the aryl π-system do not significantly affect these interactions. We also present a simple electrostatic model that further demonstrates this effect and suggests that the dominant interaction for simple substituents is the interaction of the charged ion with the local dipole associated with the substituents.Finally, we discuss substituent effects in electrostatic potentials (ESPs), which are widely used in discussions of noncovalent interactions. In the past, widespread misconceptions have confused the relationship between changes in ESPs and local changes in the electron density. We have shown that computed ESP plots of diverse substituted arenes can be reproduced without altering the aryl π-density. This is because substituent-induced changes in the ESP above the center of aryl rings result primarily from through-space effects of substituents rather than through changes in the distribution of the π-electron density.},

As a consequence, there have been a number of investigations on dimers involving benzene or other substituted π systems. In this Feature Article, we examine the relevance of the magnitudes of their attractive and repulsive interaction energy components in governing the geometries of several π−π systems. The geometries and the associated binding energies were evaluated at the complete basis set (CBS) limit of coupled cluster theory with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples excitations [CCSD(T)] using a least biased scheme for the given data set. The results for the benzene dimer indicate that the floppy T-shaped structure (center-to-center distance:  4.96 Å, with an axial benzene off-centered above the facial benzene) is isoenergetic in zero-point-energy (ZPE) corrected binding energy (D0) to the displaced-stacked structure (vertical interplanar distance:  3.54 Å). However, the T-shaped structure is likely to be slightly more stable (D0 ≈ 2.4−2.5 kcal/mol) if quadruple excitations are included in the coupled cluster calculations. The presence of substituents on the aromatic ring, irrespective of their electron withdrawing or donating nature, leads to an increase in the binding energy, and the displaced-stacked conformations are more stabilized than the T-shaped conformers. This explains the wide prevalence of displaced stacked structures in organic crystals. Despite that the dispersion energy is dominating, the substituent as well as the conformational effects are correlated to the electrostatic interaction. This electrostatic origin implies that the substituent effect would be reduced in polar solution, but important in apolar media, in particular, for assembling processes.},
