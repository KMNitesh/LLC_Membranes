text with appropriate numbering.

\section*{Response to Reviewer 1}

\begin{enumerate}[label={Comment \theenumi :}, leftmargin=3.9\parindent]

    \item \textit{The manuscript by Coscia et al. analyzes diffusion and transport of solute molecules
    in a low water content lyotropic liquid crystal using a statistical model developed on the basis 
    of molecular dynamics simulations. The purpose of the statistical model is two-fold; first to 
    extrapolate computed MSDs to longer times to obtain diffusion coefficients, and second to attempt
    to gain increased physical insight on diffusion mechanisms. These issues are important in 
    highly-confined/low-water content nanoporous materials, in which diffusion occurs through complex
    mechanisms and over long timescales. The manuscript will most likely be of interest to the community
    interested in nanoporous materials for separations.}
    
    Author reply:
    
    \item \textit {Unfortunately, because there is no comparison with alternative techniques, it is 
    very difficult to evaluate this new approach relative to previous work that has examined similar 
    issues. There exist numerous other methods for extrapolating MSDs to longer time, which the 
    authors have not discussed. One such method is the “trajectory-extending kinetic Monte Carlo” 
    (TEKMC) approach of Brown and coworkers see e.g. Macromolecules 2010, 43, 9210-9214, 
    Macromolecules 2015, 48, 7346-7358, and J. Phys Chem. B, 2012, 116, 95-103. The authors should 
    add a comprehensive discussion of how their approach compares to this and similar methods. The 
    paper would be significantly improved if the authors were to perform and present TEKMC results 
    for their system, so that one could better evaluate the performance of their proposed method.}
    
    Author reply:
    
    %BJC: not sure if I should ignore the JCTC part completely or basically just say what the editor said.
    \item \textit{Much of the writing seems more suitable for JCTC rather than JPC. I encourage the
    authors to better emphasize and discuss “new physical insight” and “chemical details”, and spend
    less time on methodology. For example pages 5-16 are all on methodology, yet it is not until 
    Figure 8 of the paper (page 26) that the authors give any description of what the LLC system 
    they are studying is actually composed of. Presumably the LLC is made up of self-assembled 
    monomers (in water) shown in Figure 8a). I would encourage the authors to describe their 
    system more concretely much earlier in the paper... there is also no information on system 
    size, box dimensions, etc.}
    
    Author reply: We thank the reviewer for pushing us to include more details about our 
  molecular simulations in order to boost reproducibility. The length of the manuscript made
  us wary to include information that could be accessed elsewhere, however there are 
  benefits to keep this very important section self-contained.
  
  We added the following text to address comments related to our choice of force field:
  
  New text:
  \begin{quote}
  We modeled water molecules using the TIP3P water model,~\cite{jorgensen_comparison_1983}
  We used the Antechamber module shipped with AmberTools18 to parameterize monomers and 
  solutes using the Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF).~\cite{wang_development_2004} We 
  assigned charges using the AM1-BCC model.~\cite{jakalian_fast_2000,jakalian_fast_2002}
  GAFF is very commonly used in simulations with diverse organic chemical functionality, 
  and was developed for consistency within the AMBER ecosystem, which uses TIP3P as the
  water model. We chose these standard force fields and generalizable parameterization 
  approaches so that a range of solutes and monomers could be self-consistently and easily 
  studied. The main goal of this work is to develop stochastic models which can reproduce
  solute behavior on MD time scales, independent of the choice of force field. In future 
  work, it may be beneficial to employ specialized force fields, including polarizable 
  force fields or other higher-order effects in order to improve the accuracy of structure 
  parameters and selectivity predictions.

  \item \textit{Lastly, it would be natural to report the size of the system in this
              section (I found it eventually in the introduction after searching for it 
              throughout the manuscript).}
              
              Author reply:
              
              We thank the reviewer for pointing out this missing piece of information. We
              have added the following text in order to inform the reader of the system's size:
			  \begin{quote} 
			  Each unit cell contains $\sim$ 62,000 total atoms.
			  \end{quote}
    
    Author reply:

    \item \textit{The authors should more clearly note that their discussion largely applies only 
    to very low water content LLC regimes (such as the 10\% LLC studied). For higher water content 
    LLCs (e.g. > 15-20\%) it is straightforward to obtain the diffusion limit from standard MD 
    simulations. While the authors are surely well aware of this, the reader may not be, and it is
    important to clearly distinguish the regimes.}

    \item \textit{In the HDP-AR-HMM method, it is not clear to me how the solute molecules are 
    constrained to be confined within the pore radius (which they must be on physical grounds 
    based on steric interactions). From Figure 2, it “looks” like this happens to work out, but
    for more complicated systems (e.g. gyroid LLCs with 3D channels) such a constraint may be 
    necessary and it is unclear how the method would generalize. This should be discussed.}
    
    \item \textit{As stated in the introduction, one motivation for the work is that “...one 
    cannot reliably compute diffusion constants because MSDs are often non-linear on the timescales
    accessible to molecular simulation”. Later on in section 2.4, the authors state “For the 
    purposes of our analysis, we assume ergodicity of the 24 solute trajectories.” These are 
    contradictory statements. If the trajectories are ergodic, then MSDs will be linear by 
    definition The authors should clarify. Similarly, in Figure 7, if the simulations are indeed 
    ergodic the red and blue bars should be proportional to each other.}
    
    \item \textit{There are no units on Figure 1 y-axis, presumably these are nanometer like the 
    other figures?}
    
    \item \textit{Figure captions need to be improved. Wording such as “we plotted...”, “we 
    calculated...”, “We also analyzed...” should be omitted in figure captions.}

\section*{Response to Reviewer 2}

\begin{enumerate}[label={Comment \theenumi :}, leftmargin=3.9\parindent]  

    %r2_comment1
    \item \textit{This paper presents an approach to study transport mechanisms of solutes within
    membranes by applying the sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process autoregressive hidden Markov model
    (HDP-AR-HMM) to molecular dynamics simulation trajectories spanning long times (5 microseconds). 
    Using this method, the authors reveal different dynamic states associated with the transport of 
    solute across a membrane, and interpret them on the basis of solute-membrane interactions. The 
    paper is clear, well written, and relevant to the Journal of Physical Chemistry. I only have a 
    couple of suggestions and minor corrections:}
    
    Author reply: We thank the reviewer for their kind assessment of our work.

    %r2_comment2
    \item \textit{A motivation for the study is providing a computational tool to guide experimentalists
    in designing membrane materials. However, given the length of the molecular dynamics simulations 
    required, it is presumably impractical to carry a large-scale screening in this way. It would be 
    useful if the authors were more explicit about the role of this approach in guiding experiments, 
    and what would be its advantages and limitations compared to a purely experimental search.}
    
    Author reply: We thank the reviewer for pushing us to further evaluate the practicality of our
    method as a tool for experimentalists. In short, there are many ways we can envision that 
    would make this approach more amenable to high throughput simulations. The length of our 
    simulations in this paper are indeed quite long. The dynamics of the solutes are somewhat 
    slow and we wanted to ensure we gathered enough data for a sufficient parameterization. 
    Putting aside brute force high throughput simulations that could be enabled by the 
    ever-increasing availability of HPC resources, it would be to our benefit to use the system
    in this work as a benchmark to explore much less expensive models.
    %BJC: I'm not exactly sure where to put this. Originally I thought conclusions because it's
    %not really a method, but seemed to make the most sense near the system description.
    We propose some ideas to this end in the text we have added to the end of Section 2.1, where
    our simulations are described:
    \begin{quote}
    In consideration of our ultimate goal, which is to use high-throughput simulations to 
    facilitate our understanding of LLC membrane design for solute-specific separations, the size 
    of our system and length of the accompanying molecular simulations appears to be somewhat 
    impractical. We would like to emphasize that our large, fully atomistic models will be
    extremely valuable as a benchmark systems used to explore less expensive models. For example, we 
    could explore systems built with fewer LLC monomers by making the membrane pores shorter. We 
    could also build systems with higher concentrations of solutes in order to gather more 
    dynamical data on shorter timescales. Using what we have learned about the radial distribution
    functions of these solutes in this and our previous work\cite{}, it may be possible to 
    learn how to create initial configurations with solutes initially distributed in a way that
    is close to their equilibrium distribution, allowing solutes to thoroughly explore the 
    accessible membrane structural space more quickly and reducing the amount unequilibrated
    data that must be discarded. % could mention GCMC?
    Finally, it may be possible to speed up our simulations by 
    reducing the number of atoms using united-atom representations of the liquid crystal monomers.
    %BJC: How strong of an influence would hydrogen mass repartitioning have on hydrogen bonding?
    %, or by using hydrogen mass repartitioning to allow us to increase the MD time step. 
    
    \end{quote}
    
    %r2_comment3
    \item \textit{Have the authors attempted to compare their results directly to experimental data? 
    It would be useful to clarify whether the predicted selectivities are expected to be quantitatively
    accurate or just reflect trends.}
		 
    %BJC: This is copied straight from the reviewer response for the previous paper.
    Author reply: The reviewer makes a valid point. This work started in parallel with experimental
    work which promised solute flux and selectivities that we could compare directly to our
	simulations. However, synthesizing an aligned hexagonal phase membrane has been a practical
	challenge for our experimental collaborators and much of their focus has shifted to 
	membranes formed by liquid crystals that self-assemble into bicontinuous cubic architectures
	which are much simpler to synthesize. We have also started to shift our focus towards models 
	of the bicontinuous cubic phase, which do have much more experimental data. However, our 
	research into generating physically accurate molecular models of that phase lags our work on
	time series modeling. In future work, we will be able to apply this technique to these 
	bicontinuous systems for which we have experimental data.

    %r2_comment4    
    \item \textit{As two very minor corrections, in page 15 line 8 it should say "Method 1", and in 
    page 17 line 5 the angle should be H-D-A.}
    
    % BJC: reviewer is right, VMD docs are misleading: https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/plugins/hbonds/
    Author reply: We thank the reviewer for pointing out our potential errors. For the hydrogen bond
    criteria we have updated the text from "D-H-A" to "H-D-A". Regarding page 15 line 8 (\textit{"Method 2:
    Since trajectories generated by Method 2..."}), changing "Method 2" to "Method 1" would actually be 
    incorrect. At the beginning of Section 2.4, we defined two techniques for generating stochastic 
    trajectories. 'Method 2' on page 15 line 8 describes the bootstrapping procedures for Method 2 of
    trajectory generation. This is a clear lack of clarity on the author's part and therefore we 
    have made an effort to avoid to change our wording to avoid confusion.
    
    First, we added additional clarification before describing the bootstrapping procedure (added text
    is highlighted in red):
    \begin{quote}
    Our bootstrapping procedure varied dependent on the method of trajectory generation. \textcolor{red}{
    The following procedures correspond to the methods described above:}
    \end{quote}
    
    We have also modified the text on page 15 line 8 from the orginal text:
    \begin{quote}
    Since trajectories generated by Method 2 are based on the clustered parameter set used to define a
    single model, we can bootstrap on trajectory ensembles of arbitrary size.
    \end{quote}
    to:
    \begin{quote}
    Since in our second approach to stochastic trajectory generation described above we use clustered 
    parameter sets to define each model, we can bootstrap on trajectory ensembles of arbitrary size.
    \end{quote}
