	abstract = {Subdiffusive processes have become a field of great interest in the last decades, due to amounting experimental evidence of subdiffusive behavior in complex systems, and especially in biological systems. Different physical scenarios leading to subdiffusion differ in the details of the dynamics. These differences are what allow to theoretically reconstruct the underlying physics from the results of observations, and will be the topic of this review. We review the main statistical analyses available today to distinguish between these scenarios, categorizing them according to the relevant characteristics. We collect the available tools and statistical tests, presenting them within a broader perspective. We also consider possible complications such as the subordination of subdiffusive mechanisms. Due to the advances in single particle tracking experiments in recent years, we focus on the relevant case of where the available experimental data is scant, at the level of single trajectories.},

	abstract = {Periodic, nanostructured porous polymer membranes made from the cross-linked inverted hexagonal phase of self-assembled lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) are a promising class of materials for selective separations. In this work, we investigate an experimentally characterized LLC polymer membrane using atomistic molecular modeling. In particular, we compare simulated X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns with experimental XRD data to quantify and understand the differences between simulation and experiment. We find that the nanopores are likely composed of five columns of stacked LLC monomers which surround each hydrophilic core. Evidence suggests that these columns likely move independently of each other over longer time scales than accessible via atomistic simulation. We also find that wide-angle X-ray scattering structural features previously attributed to monomer tail tilt are likely instead due to ordered tail packing. Although this system has been reported as dry, we show that small amounts of water are necessary to reproduce all features from the experimental XRD pattern because of asymmetries introduced by hydrogen bonds between the monomer head groups and water molecules. Finally, we explore the composition and structure of the nanopores and reveal that there exists a composition gradient rather than an abrupt partition between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. A caveat is that the time scales of the dynamics are extremely long for this system, resulting in simulated structures that appear too ordered, thus requiring careful examination of the metastable states observed in order to draw any conclusions. The clear picture of the nanoscopic structure of these membranes provided in this study will enable a better understanding of the mechanisms of small-molecule transport within these nanopores.},

Here, we suggest a conceptually simple automated procedure that does not make strict assumptions about the distribution of the observable of interest in which the equilibration time is chosen to maximize the number of effectively uncorrelated samples in the production timespan used to compute equilibrium averages. We present a simple Python reference implementation of this procedure and demonstrate its utility on typical molecular simulation data.},

The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

	abstract = {Current commercial nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membranes are limited in scope and performance due to their physicochemical properties. Desalination of hydraulic fracturing wastewater poses a particular challenge to membrane filtration given the high concentrations of both organic compounds and salts present in these waters. The recently-developed nanoporous, bicontinuous cubic, lyotropic liquid crystal, thin-film-composite polymer membrane (TFC QI membrane), having unique physicochemical properties, enables an alternative treatment of hydraulic fracturing wastewater. Specifically, the TFC QI membrane recovers the organic compounds from this high-salinity wastewater, enabling biodegradation to occur after desalination. However, other performance criteria must be demonstrated for a membrane to reach application. The work presented herein demonstrates the stable performance of the TFC QI membrane during 66 h of cross-flow filtration of hydraulic fracturing produced water. Compared to the commercial NF90 membrane, the TFC QI membrane recovered a larger portion of the organic compounds, had a higher thickness-normalized water flux, and fouled less. The combination of the TFC QI membrane’s selectivity with its reduced fouling propensity makes possible a treatment for hydraulic fracturing wastewater and other complex aqueous streams inaccessible by most commercial membranes, motivating the further study and development of the TFC QI membrane.},

By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

The problem is rendered particularly difficult by the fact that we are not allowed to assume knowledge of the number of people participating in the meeting. To address this problem, we take a Bayesian nonparametric approach to speaker diarization that builds on the hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) of Teh et al. [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 101 (2006) 1566–1581]. Although the basic HDP-HMM tends to over-segment the audio data—creating redundant states and rapidly switching among them—we describe an augmented HDP-HMM that provides effective control over the switching rate. We also show that this augmentation makes it possible to treat emission distributions nonparametrically. To scale the resulting architecture to realistic diarization problems, we develop a sampling algorithm that employs a truncated approximation of the Dirichlet process to jointly resample the full state sequence, greatly improving mixing rates. Working with a benchmark NIST data set, we show that our Bayesian nonparametric architecture yields state-of-the-art speaker diarization results.},

	abstract = {Understanding the basis for intracellular motion is critical as the field moves toward a deeper understanding of the relation between Brownian forces, molecular crowding, and anisotropic (or isotropic) energetic forcing. Effective forces and other parameters used to summarize molecular motion change over time in live cells due to latent state changes, e.g., changes induced by dynamic micro-environments, photobleaching, and other heterogeneity inherent in biological processes. This study discusses limitations in currently popular analysis methods (e.g., mean square displacement-based analyses) and how new techniques can be used to systematically analyze Single Particle Tracking (SPT) data experiencing abrupt state changes in time or space. The approach is to track GFP tagged chromatids in metaphase in live yeast cells and quantitatively probe the effective forces resulting from dynamic interactions that reflect the sum of a number of physical phenomena. State changes can be induced by various sources including: microtubule dynamics exerting force through the centromere, thermal polymer fluctuations, and DNA-based molecular machines including polymerases and protein exchange complexes such as chaperones and chromatin remodeling complexes. Simulations aiming to show the relevance of the approach to more general SPT data analyses are also studied. Refined force estimates are obtained by adopting and modifying a nonparametric Bayesian modeling technique, the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (HDP-SLDS), for SPT applications. The HDP-SLDS method shows promise in systematically identifying dynamical regime changes induced by unobserved state changes when the number of underlying states is unknown in advance (a common problem in SPT applications). We expand on the relevance of the HDP-SLDS approach, review the relevant background of Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, show how to map discrete time HDP-SLDS models to classic SPT models, and discuss limitations of the approach. In addition, we demonstrate new computational techniques for tuning hyperparameters and for checking the statistical consistency of model assumptions directly against individual experimental trajectories; the techniques circumvent the need for “ground-truth” and/or subjective information.},

Recent global military events, such as the conflict and disarmament in Syria2, have brought into focus the need to find effective strategies for the rapid destruction of these banned chemicals. Solutions are needed for immediate personal protection (for example, the filtration and catalytic destruction of airborne versions of agents), bulk destruction of chemical weapon stockpiles, protection (via coating) of clothing, equipment and buildings, and containment of agent spills3. Solid heterogeneous materials such as modified activated carbon or metal oxides exhibit many desirable characteristics for the destruction of chemical warfare agents4,5,6. However, low sorptive capacities, low effective active site loadings, deactivation of the active site, slow degradation kinetics, and/or a lack of tailorability offer significant room for improvement in these materials. Here, we report a carefully chosen metal–organic framework (MOF) material featuring high porosity and exceptional chemical stability that is extraordinarily effective for the degradation of nerve agents and their simulants. Experimental and computational evidence points to Lewis-acidic ZrIV ions as the active sites and to their superb accessibility as a defining element of their efficacy.},

Conventional water and wastewater treatment are not efficient in removing this kind of organic micropollutants of emerging concern. Advanced treatment processes seem to be a good alternative for PhACs removal either in drinking water or wastewater. Membrane separation processes were proved to be a good treatment option since they are able to produce a high quality permeate without increasing its toxicity. Microfiltration, ultrafiltration and membrane bioreactor can be applied to the treatment of wastewater due to the high concentration of organic matter. Nanofiltration and reverse osmosis are mainly applied for water treatment. Their rejection mechanisms and the interactions between PhACs and NOM or inorganic salts are well understood. It is consensual that tighter NF membranes are more efficient than looser membranes, reaching {\textgreater}99\% of removal. Membrane distillation is a relatively new technology especially because of its robustness in dealing with a broad spectrum of pollutants, however only a few studied are focused on the application of MD in removing PhACs from water and wastewater and few are known about the rejection mechanisms and the interaction between PhACs, NOM, inorganic salts and membrane. MSP, specially MD, is a very promising technology to be applied in order to prevent public health and environmental problems caused by the release of PhACs in the environment.},

The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions.

This framework requires one to make fewer assumptions about the underlying dynamics, and thereby allows the data to drive the complexity of the inferred model. We began by examining a Bayesian nonparametric HMM, the sticky HDPHMM, that uses a hierarchical DP prior to regularize an unbounded mode space. We then considered extensions to Markov switching processes with richer, conditionally linear dynamics, including the HDP-AR-HMM and HDP-SLDS. We concluded by considering methods for transferring knowledge among multiple related time series. We argued that a featural representation is more appropriate than a rigid global clustering, as it encourages sharing of behaviors among objects while still allowing sequence-specific variability. In this context, the beta process provides an appealing alternative to the DP.},

VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more “representations,” in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs.

	abstract = {The properties of the inflation process and especially possible changes in its persistence have received much attention in the literature. However, empirical evidence is ambiguous. Some studies find that inflation persistence varied over time, others conclude it was constant. This article contributes further evidence to this ongoing debate by modeling U.S. inflation dynamics using a sticky infinite hidden Markov model (sticky IHMM). The sticky IHMM is a Bayesian nonparametric approach to modeling structural breaks. It allows for an unknown number of breakpoints and is a flexible and attractive alternative to existing methods. We found that inflation persistence was highest in 1973-74 and then again around 1980. However, credible intervals for our estimates of inflation persistence were very wide. Thus, a substantial amount of uncertainty about this aspect of inflation dynamics remained.},

	abstract = {Markov-switching models are usually specified under the assumption that all the parameters change when a regime switch occurs. Relaxing this hypothesis and being able to detect which parameters evolve over time is relevant for interpreting the changes in the dynamics of the series, for specifying models parsimoniously, and may be helpful in forecasting. We propose the class of sticky infinite hidden Markov-switching autoregressive moving average models, in which we disentangle the break dynamics of the mean and the variance parameters. In this class, the number of regimes is possibly infinite and is determined when estimating the model, thus avoiding the need to set this number by a model choice criterion. We develop a new Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation method that solves the path dependence issue due to the moving average component. Empirical results on macroeconomic series illustrate that the proposed class of models dominates the model with fixed parameters in terms of point and density forecasts.},

It also naturally predicts the spelling of unobserved forms that are missing from these paradigms, and discovers inflectional principles (grammar) that generalize to wholly unobserved words. Our Bayesian generative model of the data explicitly represents tokens, types, inflections, paradigms, and locally conditioned string edits. It assumes that inflected word tokens are generated from an infinite mixture of inflectional paradigms (string tuples). Each paradigm is sampled all at once from a graphical model, whose potential functions are weighted finite-state transducers with language-specific parameters to be learned. These assumptions naturally lead to an elegant empirical Bayes inference procedure that exploits Monte Carlo EM, belief propagation, and dynamic programming. Given 50--100 seed paradigms, adding a 10-million-word corpus reduces prediction error for morphological inflections by up to 10\%.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07905},
	abstract = {Mathematically modeling complex transport phenomena at the molecular level can be a powerful tool for identifying transport mechanisms and predicting macroscopic properties. We use two different stochastic time series models, parameterized from long molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories of a cross-linked H\$\_\{II\}\$ phase lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) membrane, in order to predict solute mean squared displacements (MSDs) and solute flux, and thus solute selectivity, in macroscopic length pores. First, using anomalous diffusion theory, we show how solute dynamics can be modeled as a fractional diffusion process subordinate to a continuous time random walk. From the MD simulations, we parameterize the distribution of dwell times, hop lengths between dwells and correlation between hops. We explore two variations of the anomalous diffusion modeling approach. The first applies a single set of parameters to the solute displacements and the second applies two sets of parameters based on the solute's radial distance from the closest pore center. Next, we generalize Markov state models, treating the configurational states of the system as a Markov process where each state has distinct transport properties. For each state and transition between states, we parameterize the distribution and temporal correlation structure of positional fluctuations as a means of characterization and to allow us to predict solute MSDs. Qualitative differences between MD and Markov state dependent model-generated trajectories may limit its usefulness. Finally, we demonstrate how one can use these models to estimate flux of a solute across a macroscopic-length pore and, based on those quantities, the membrane's selectivity towards each solute. This work helps to connect microscopic chemically-dependent solute motions that do not follow simple diffusive behavior with macroscopic membrane performance.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Fluorescence time traces are used to report on dynamical properties of biomolecules. The basic unit of information drawn from these traces is the individual photon. Single photons carry instantaneous information from the biomolecule, from which they are emitted, to the detector on timescales as fast as microseconds. Thus from confocal microscope it is theoretically possible to monitor biomolecular dynamics at such timescales. In practice, however, signals are stochastic and in order to deduce dynamical information through traditional means–such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and related techniques–fluorescence signals are collected and temporally auto-correlated over several minutes. So far, it has been impossible to analyze dynamical properties of biomolecules on timescales approaching data acquisition as this demands that we estimate the instantaneous number of biomolecules emitting photons and their positions within the confocal volume. The mathematical structure of this problem demands that we abandon the normal (“parametric”) Bayesian paradigm. Here, we exploit novel mathematical tools, namely Bayesian nonparametrics, that allow us to deduce in a principled fashion the same information normally deduced from FCS but from the direct analysis of significantly smaller datasets starting from individual photon arrivals. We discuss the implications of this method in helping dramatically reduce phototoxic damage on the sample and the ability to monitor out-of-equilibrium processes.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Petrie (1966) and gives practical details on methods of implementation of the theory along with a description of selected applications of the theory to distinct problems in speech recognition. Results from a number of original sources are combined to provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied, including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Some MCMC methods used in practice (for computing likelihood, conditional probabilities of hidden states, and the most likely sequence of states) can be improved by incorporating established recursive algorithms. The most important of these is a set of forward-backward recursions calculating conditional distributions of the hidden states given observed data and model parameters. I show how to use the recursive algorithms in an MCMC context and demonstrate mathematical and empirical results showing a Gibbs sampler using the forward-backward recursions mixes more rapidly than another sampler often used for HMMs. Iintroduce an augmented variables technique for obtaining unique state labels in HMMs and finite mixture models. I show how recursive computing allows the statistically efficient use of MCMC output when estimating the hidden states. I directly calculate the posterior distribution of the hidden chain's state-space size by MCMC, circumventing asymptotic arguments underlying the Bayesian information criterion, which is shown to be inappropriate for a frequently analyzed dataset in the HMM literature. The use of log-likelihood for assessing MCMC convergence is illustrated, and posterior predictive checks are used to investigate application specific questions of model adequacy.},

This is primarily because of the emergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. While MCMC provides a convenient way to draw inference from complicated statistical models, there are many, perhaps underappreciated, problems associated with the MCMC analysis of mixtures. The problems are mainly caused by the nonidentifiability of the components under symmetric priors, which leads to so-called label switching in the MCMC output. This means that ergodic averages of component specific quantities will be identical and thus useless for inference. We review the solutions to the label switching problem, such as artificial identifiability constraints, relabelling algorithms and label invariant loss functions. We also review various MCMC sampling schemes that have been suggested for mixture models and discuss posterior sensitivity to prior specification.},

As a modeling tool, iHMMs can analyze sequential data without a priori setting a specific number of states as required for the traditional (finite) HMM. Although the current literature on the iHMM is primarily intended for audiences in statistics, the idea is powerful and the iHMM’s breadth in applicability outside machine learning and data science warrants a careful exposition. Here, we explain the key ideas underlying the iHMM, with a special emphasis on implementation, and provide a description of a code we are making freely available.

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can be used to estimate transition rates between conformational substates of the simulated molecule. Such an estimation is associated with statistical uncertainty, which depends on the number of observed transitions. In turn, it induces uncertainties in any property computed from the simulation, such as free energy differences or the time scales involved in the system’s kinetics. Assessing these uncertainties is essential for testing the reliability of a given observation and also to plan further simulations in such a way that the most serious uncertainties will be reduced with minimal effort. Here, a rigorous statistical method is proposed to approximate the complete statistical distribution of any observable of an MD simulation provided that one can identify conformational substates such that the transition process between them may be modeled with a memoryless jump process, i.e., Markov or Master equation dynamics. The method is based on sampling the statistical distribution of Markov transition matrices that is induced by the observed transition events. It allows physically meaningful constraints to be included, such as sampling only matrices that fulfill detailed balance, or matrices that produce a predefined equilibrium distribution of states. The method is illustrated on μsμs{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll" altimg="eq-00001.gif"{\textgreater}{\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi{\textgreater}μ{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="normal"{\textgreater}s{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}/math{\textgreater} MD simulations of a hexapeptide for which the distributions and uncertainties of the free energy differences between conformations, the transition matrix elements, and the transition matrix eigenvalues are estimated.

	abstract = {Markov state models (MSMs) have been successful in computing metastable states, slow relaxation timescales and associated structural changes, and stationary or kinetic experimental observables of complex molecules from large amounts of molecular dynamics simulation data. However, MSMs approximate the true dynamics by assuming a Markov chain on a clusters discretization of the state space. This approximation is difficult to make for high-dimensional biomolecular systems, and the quality and reproducibility of MSMs has, therefore, been limited. Here, we discard the assumption that dynamics are Markovian on the discrete clusters. Instead, we only assume that the full phase-space molecular dynamics is Markovian, and a projection of this full dynamics is observed on the discrete states, leading to the concept of Projected Markov Models (PMMs). Robust estimation methods for PMMs are not yet available, but we derive a practically feasible approximation via Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). It is shown how various molecular observables of interest that are often computed from MSMs can be computed from HMMs/PMMs. The new framework is applicable to both, simulation and single-molecule experimental data. We demonstrate its versatility by applications to educative model systems, a 1 ms Anton MD simulation of the bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor protein, and an optical tweezer force probe trajectory of an RNA hairpin.},

Boltzmann probability models of sequence-dependent DNA structure from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were obtained and incorporated into hidden Markov models (HMMs) that can recognize molecular structural signals as well as sequence in protein–DNA binding sites on a genome. The binding of catabolite activator protein (CAP) to cognate DNA sequences was used as a prototype case for implementation and testing of the method. The results indicate that even HMMs based on probabilistic roll/tilt dinucleotide models of sequence-dependent DNA structure have some capability to discriminate between known CAP binding and nonbinding sites and to predict putative CAP binding sites in unknowns. Restricting HMMs to sequence only in regions of strong consensus in which the protein makes base specific contacts with the cognate DNA further improved the discriminatory capabilities of the HMMs. Comparison of results with controls based on sequence only indicates that extending the definition of consensus from sequence to structure improves the transferability of the HMMs, and provides further supportive evidence of a role for dynamical molecular structure as well as sequence in genomic regulatory mechanisms.},

The method identifies the number of diffusive states and the state transition rates. Using this method we have created an objective interaction map for Hfq, a protein that mediates interactions between small regulatory RNAs and their mRNA targets.},

Here we describe a single-molecule method to sense these changes in real time based on statistical learning of diffusive and electric field-induced motion parameters of a trapped molecule in solution. We demonstrate the approach by resolving a monomer-trimer mixture along a protein dissociation pathway and visualizing the binding-unbinding kinetics of a single DNA molecule.},

	abstract = {Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), is a widely used tool routinely exploited for in vivo and in vitro applications. While FCS provides estimates of dynamical quantities, such as diffusion coefficients, it demands high signal to noise ratios and long time traces, typically in the minute range. In principle, the same information can be extracted from microseconds to seconds long time traces; however, an appropriate analysis method is missing. To overcome these limitations, we adapt novel tools inspired by Bayesian non-parametrics, which starts from the direct analysis of the observed photon counts. With this approach, we are able to analyze time traces, which are too short to be analyzed by existing methods, including FCS. Our new analysis extends the capability of single molecule fluorescence confocal microscopy approaches to probe processes several orders of magnitude faster and permits a reduction of photo-toxic effects on living samples induced by long periods of light exposure.},
