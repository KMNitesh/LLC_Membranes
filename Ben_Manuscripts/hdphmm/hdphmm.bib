	abstract = {Subdiffusive processes have become a field of great interest in the last decades, due to amounting experimental evidence of subdiffusive behavior in complex systems, and especially in biological systems. Different physical scenarios leading to subdiffusion differ in the details of the dynamics. These differences are what allow to theoretically reconstruct the underlying physics from the results of observations, and will be the topic of this review. We review the main statistical analyses available today to distinguish between these scenarios, categorizing them according to the relevant characteristics. We collect the available tools and statistical tests, presenting them within a broader perspective. We also consider possible complications such as the subordination of subdiffusive mechanisms. Due to the advances in single particle tracking experiments in recent years, we focus on the relevant case of where the available experimental data is scant, at the level of single trajectories.},

	abstract = {Periodic, nanostructured porous polymer membranes made from the cross-linked inverted hexagonal phase of self-assembled lyotropic liquid crystals (LLCs) are a promising class of materials for selective separations. In this work, we investigate an experimentally characterized LLC polymer membrane using atomistic molecular modeling. In particular, we compare simulated X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns with experimental XRD data to quantify and understand the differences between simulation and experiment. We find that the nanopores are likely composed of five columns of stacked LLC monomers which surround each hydrophilic core. Evidence suggests that these columns likely move independently of each other over longer time scales than accessible via atomistic simulation. We also find that wide-angle X-ray scattering structural features previously attributed to monomer tail tilt are likely instead due to ordered tail packing. Although this system has been reported as dry, we show that small amounts of water are necessary to reproduce all features from the experimental XRD pattern because of asymmetries introduced by hydrogen bonds between the monomer head groups and water molecules. Finally, we explore the composition and structure of the nanopores and reveal that there exists a composition gradient rather than an abrupt partition between the hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. A caveat is that the time scales of the dynamics are extremely long for this system, resulting in simulated structures that appear too ordered, thus requiring careful examination of the metastable states observed in order to draw any conclusions. The clear picture of the nanoscopic structure of these membranes provided in this study will enable a better understanding of the mechanisms of small-molecule transport within these nanopores.},

Here, we suggest a conceptually simple automated procedure that does not make strict assumptions about the distribution of the observable of interest in which the equilibration time is chosen to maximize the number of effectively uncorrelated samples in the production timespan used to compute equilibrium averages. We present a simple Python reference implementation of this procedure and demonstrate its utility on typical molecular simulation data.},

	abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

The problem is rendered particularly difficult by the fact that we are not allowed to assume knowledge of the number of people participating in the meeting. To address this problem, we take a Bayesian nonparametric approach to speaker diarization that builds on the hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) of Teh et al. [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 101 (2006) 1566–1581]. Although the basic HDP-HMM tends to over-segment the audio data—creating redundant states and rapidly switching among them—we describe an augmented HDP-HMM that provides effective control over the switching rate. We also show that this augmentation makes it possible to treat emission distributions nonparametrically. To scale the resulting architecture to realistic diarization problems, we develop a sampling algorithm that employs a truncated approximation of the Dirichlet process to jointly resample the full state sequence, greatly improving mixing rates. Working with a benchmark NIST data set, we show that our Bayesian nonparametric architecture yields state-of-the-art speaker diarization results.},

	abstract = {Understanding the basis for intracellular motion is critical as the field moves toward a deeper understanding of the relation between Brownian forces, molecular crowding, and anisotropic (or isotropic) energetic forcing. Effective forces and other parameters used to summarize molecular motion change over time in live cells due to latent state changes, e.g., changes induced by dynamic micro-environments, photobleaching, and other heterogeneity inherent in biological processes. This study discusses limitations in currently popular analysis methods (e.g., mean square displacement-based analyses) and how new techniques can be used to systematically analyze Single Particle Tracking (SPT) data experiencing abrupt state changes in time or space. The approach is to track GFP tagged chromatids in metaphase in live yeast cells and quantitatively probe the effective forces resulting from dynamic interactions that reflect the sum of a number of physical phenomena. State changes can be induced by various sources including: microtubule dynamics exerting force through the centromere, thermal polymer fluctuations, and DNA-based molecular machines including polymerases and protein exchange complexes such as chaperones and chromatin remodeling complexes. Simulations aiming to show the relevance of the approach to more general SPT data analyses are also studied. Refined force estimates are obtained by adopting and modifying a nonparametric Bayesian modeling technique, the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (HDP-SLDS), for SPT applications. The HDP-SLDS method shows promise in systematically identifying dynamical regime changes induced by unobserved state changes when the number of underlying states is unknown in advance (a common problem in SPT applications). We expand on the relevance of the HDP-SLDS approach, review the relevant background of Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, show how to map discrete time HDP-SLDS models to classic SPT models, and discuss limitations of the approach. In addition, we demonstrate new computational techniques for tuning hyperparameters and for checking the statistical consistency of model assumptions directly against individual experimental trajectories; the techniques circumvent the need for “ground-truth” and/or subjective information.},

Here, we present a new implementation of our molecular simulation toolkit GROMACS which now both achieves extremely high performance on single processors from algorithmic optimizations and hand-coded routines and simultaneously scales very well on parallel machines. The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes.},

This framework requires one to make fewer assumptions about the underlying dynamics, and thereby allows the data to drive the complexity of the inferred model. We began by examining a Bayesian nonparametric HMM, the sticky HDPHMM, that uses a hierarchical DP prior to regularize an unbounded mode space. We then considered extensions to Markov switching processes with richer, conditionally linear dynamics, including the HDP-AR-HMM and HDP-SLDS. We concluded by considering methods for transferring knowledge among multiple related time series. We argued that a featural representation is more appropriate than a rigid global clustering, as it encourages sharing of behaviors among objects while still allowing sequence-specific variability. In this context, the beta process provides an appealing alternative to the DP.},

In this work, we observe the transport of water, sodium ions, and 20 small polar solutes within the pores of a lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) membrane using atomistic molecular simulations. We find that the transport of a species is dependent not only on molecular size but also on chemical functionality. The membrane’s inhomogeneous composition gives rise to radially dependent transport mechanisms with respect to the pore centers. We observe that all solutes perform intermittent hops between lengthy periods of entrapment. Three different trapping mechanisms are responsible for this behavior. First, solutes that drift out of the pore can become entangled among the dense monomer tails. Second, solutes can donate hydrogen bonds to the monomer head groups. Third, solutes can coordinate with sodium counterions. The degree to which a solute is affected by each mechanism is dependent on the chemical functionality of the solute. Using the insights developed in this study, we can begin to think about how to redesign existing LLC membranes to perform solute-specific separations.},

VMD can simultaneously display any number of structures using a wide variety of rendering styles and coloring methods. Molecules are displayed as one or more “representations,” in which each representation embodies a particular rendering method and coloring scheme for a selected subset of atoms. The atoms displayed in each representation are chosen using an extensive atom selection syntax, which includes Boolean operators and regular expressions. VMD provides a complete graphical user interface for program control, as well as a text interface using the Tcl embeddable parser to allow for complex scripts with variable substitution, control loops, and function calls. Full session logging is supported, which produces a VMD command script for later playback. High-resolution raster images of displayed molecules may be produced by generating input scripts for use by a number of photorealistic image-rendering applications. VMD has also been expressly designed with the ability to animate molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories, imported either from files or from a direct connection to a running MD simulation. VMD is the visualization component of MDScope, a set of tools for interactive problem solving in structural biology, which also includes the parallel MD program NAMD, and the MDCOMM software used to connect the visualization and simulation programs. VMD is written in C++, using an object-oriented design; the program, including source code and extensive documentation, is freely available via anonymous ftp and through the World Wide Web.},

Some studies find that inflation persistence varied over time, others conclude it was constant. This article contributes further evidence to this ongoing debate by modeling U.S. inflation dynamics using a sticky infinite hidden Markov model (sticky IHMM). The sticky IHMM is a Bayesian nonparametric approach to modeling structural breaks. It allows for an unknown number of breakpoints and is a flexible and attractive alternative to existing methods. We found that inflation persistence was highest in 1973-74 and then again around 1980. However, credible intervals for our estimates of inflation persistence were very wide. Thus, a substantial amount of uncertainty about this aspect of inflation dynamics remained.},

Relaxing this hypothesis and being able to detect which parameters evolve over time is relevant for interpreting the changes in the dynamics of the series, for specifying models parsimoniously, and may be helpful in forecasting. We propose the class of sticky infinite hidden Markov-switching autoregressive moving average models, in which we disentangle the break dynamics of the mean and the variance parameters. In this class, the number of regimes is possibly infinite and is determined when estimating the model, thus avoiding the need to set this number by a model choice criterion. We develop a new Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation method that solves the path dependence issue due to the moving average component. Empirical results on macroeconomic series illustrate that the proposed class of models dominates the model with fixed parameters in terms of point and density forecasts.},

Our Bayesian generative model of the data explicitly represents tokens, types, inflections, paradigms, and locally conditioned string edits. It assumes that inflected word tokens are generated from an infinite mixture of inflectional paradigms (string tuples). Each paradigm is sampled all at once from a graphical model, whose potential functions are weighted finite-state transducers with language-specific parameters to be learned. These assumptions naturally lead to an elegant empirical Bayes inference procedure that exploits Monte Carlo EM, belief propagation, and dynamic programming. Given 50--100 seed paradigms, adding a 10-million-word corpus reduces prediction error for morphological inflections by up to 10\%.},

With these new unabridged softcover volumes, Wiley hopes to extend the lives of these works by making them available to future generations of statisticians, mathematicians, and scientists. "Cluster analysis is the increasingly important and practical subject of finding groupings in data. The authors set out to write a book for the user who does not necessarily have an extensive background in mathematics. They succeed very well." —Mathematical Reviews "Finding Groups in Data [is] a clear, readable, and interesting presentation of a small number of clustering methods. In addition, the book introduced some interesting innovations of applied value to clustering literature." —Journal of Classification "This is a very good, easy-to-read, and practical book. It has many nice features and is highly recommended for students and practitioners in various fields of study." —Technometrics An introduction to the practical application of cluster analysis, this text presents a selection of methods that together can deal with most applications. These methods are chosen for their robustness, consistency, and general applicability. This book discusses various types of data, including interval-scaled and binary variables as well as similarity data, and explains how these can be transformed prior to clustering.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07905},
	abstract = {Mathematically modeling complex transport phenomena at the molecular level can be a powerful tool for identifying transport mechanisms and predicting macroscopic properties. We use two different stochastic time series models, parameterized from long molecular dynamics (MD) simulation trajectories of a cross-linked H\$\_\{II\}\$ phase lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) membrane, in order to predict solute mean squared displacements (MSDs) and solute flux, and thus solute selectivity, in macroscopic length pores. First, using anomalous diffusion theory, we show how solute dynamics can be modeled as a fractional diffusion process subordinate to a continuous time random walk. From the MD simulations, we parameterize the distribution of dwell times, hop lengths between dwells and correlation between hops. We explore two variations of the anomalous diffusion modeling approach. The first applies a single set of parameters to the solute displacements and the second applies two sets of parameters based on the solute's radial distance from the closest pore center. Next, we generalize Markov state models, treating the configurational states of the system as a Markov process where each state has distinct transport properties. For each state and transition between states, we parameterize the distribution and temporal correlation structure of positional fluctuations as a means of characterization and to allow us to predict solute MSDs. Qualitative differences between MD and Markov state dependent model-generated trajectories may limit its usefulness. Finally, we demonstrate how one can use these models to estimate flux of a solute across a macroscopic-length pore and, based on those quantities, the membrane's selectivity towards each solute. This work helps to connect microscopic chemically-dependent solute motions that do not follow simple diffusive behavior with macroscopic membrane performance.},
