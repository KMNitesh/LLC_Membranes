	\newcommand{\ManuscriptTitle}{Statistical Inference of Transport Mechanisms and
	Long Time Scale Behavior from Time Series of Solute Trajectories in 
	Nanostructured Membranes}
	
	We are submitting ``\ManuscriptTitle'' by Benjamin J. Coscia, Christopher P.
	Calderon and Michael R. Shirts, for	consideration for publication as a Research
	Article in the ``Machine Learning in Physical Chemistry" special issue of the Journal 
	of Physical Chemistry, specifically in part B, section B4: Fluid 
	Interfaces, Colloids, Polymers, Soft Matter, Surfactants, and Glassy Materials.
	We expect this work to be of significant interest to researchers who study complex 
	dynamics in both structured and amorphous soft materials.
	
	In this article, we apply the sticky hierarchical Dirichlet process autoregressive
	hidden Markov model (HDP-AR-HMM), a non-parametric Bayesian time series
	classification technique, to solute center-of-mass trajectories generated from
	5 $\mu s$ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in a cross-linked inverted hexagonal
	phase lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) membrane in order to automatically detect a
	variety of solute dynamical modes. We can use this information in order to 
	better understand the complex transport mechanisms exhibited by the solutes in 
	our simulation which will greatly increase the efficiency with which we 
	design LLC membranes for solute-specific separations.
	
	Our work represents a considerable advancement over our most recent study 
	characterizing the same set of solute center-of-mass time series trajectories
	(Coscia and Shirts, arXiv:2004.07905 [cond-mat.soft]). In that work, we used
	our previously gained qualitative understanding of solute transport (Coscia 
	and Shirts \textit{J. Phys. Chem. B}, 123, 6314--6330 (2019)) in order to 
	formulate stochastic models which could be used to project solute behavior
	on macroscopic time scales, thus allowing prediction of experimentally relevant
	properties like membrane selectivity. Using the HDP-AR-HMM, we can analyze solute
	trajectories with no prior knowledge of their dynamic behavior and easily produce
	models which quantitatively describe their long time scale dynamics. Since the 
	approach is non-parametric, the complexity of our data drives the complexity of
	the model. We cluster the parameter sets in order to reduce the total space of 
	dynamical states to a small set of distinct parameters which allow us to clearly
	understand physical	mechanisms in terms of solute-membrane interactions. To our 
	knowledge, this is the first application of the HDP-AR-HMM to MD data and it is
	the first time this framework has been used to gain both mechanistic and kinetic
	insight.
