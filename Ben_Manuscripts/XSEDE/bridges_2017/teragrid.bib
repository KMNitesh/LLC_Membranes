In this article, we aim to address the second task by extending the likelihood approach of Kong et al. for Monte Carlo integration. We consider a general Markov chain scheme and use partial likelihood for estimation. Basically, the Markov chain scheme is treated as a random design and a stratified estimator is defined for the baseline measure. Further, we propose useful techniques including subsampling, regulation, and amplification for achieving overall computational efficiency. Finally, we introduce approximate variance estimators for the point estimators. The method can yield substantially improved accuracy compared with Chib's estimator and the crude Monte Carlo estimator, as illustrated with three examples. {(C)} 2007 Elsevier {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The possible relationships between adrenaline-synthesizing neurons and serotoninergic afferent fibers in the nucleus tractus solitarii of the rat were investigated both morphologically and biochemically. Adrenergic elements (cell bodies, dendrites and nerve endings) were detected simultaneously with serotoninergic axonal varicosities in the same electron-microscopic sections by means of combined {phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase} immunocytochemistry and {[3H]serotonin-uptake} radioautography. Among some 500 serotoninergic varicosities scanned in the areas of significant overlap between the 2 types of labeling, only 3 were directly apposed to an adrenergic process, identified as a dendrite in each case. No synaptic membrane differentiations were seen at these occasional sites of contact. Destruction of the serotonin input by 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine had no significant effect on the tyrosine hydroxylase dopamine-beta-hydroxylase and {phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase} enzymatic activities in the C2 adrenergic region, but induced 22\% and 38\% increases of tyrosine hydroxylase and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase activities, respectively, in the neighboring A2 noradrenergic area. Taken together, these results suggest that serotoninergic and adrenergic neurons do not significantly interact in the nucleus tractus solitarii; this implies that the possible catecholaminergic relays for the action of serotonin in autonomic regulation at this level could consist of noradrenergic neurons rather than of their adrenergic counterparts.},

	abstract = {The ribosome is a large complex catalyst responsible for the synthesis of new proteins, an essential function for life. New proteins emerge from the ribosome through an exit tunnel as nascent polypeptide chains. Recent findings indicate that tunnel interactions with the nascent polypeptide chain might be relevant for the regulation of translation. However, the specific ribosomal structural features that mediate this process are unknown. Performing molecular dynamics simulations, we are studying the interactions between components of the ribosome exit tunnel and different chemical probes (specifically different amino acid side chains or monovalent inorganic ions). Our free-energy maps describe the physicochemical environment of the tunnel, revealing binding crevices and free-energy barriers for single amino acids and ions. Our simulations indicate that transport out of the tunnel could be different for diverse amino acid species. In addition, our results predict a notable {proteinâRNA} interaction between a flexible {23S} {rRNA} tetraloop (gate) and ribosomal protein L39 (latch) that could potentially obstruct the tunnel's exit. By relating our simulation data to earlier biochemical studies, we propose that ribosomal features at the exit of the tunnel can play a role in the regulation of nascent chain exit and ion flux. Moreover, our free-energy maps may provide a context for interpreting sequence-dependent nascent chain phenomenology.},

	abstract = {A fragment-based method for computing proteinâligand binding free energies by systematic sampling has been developed. Systematic sampling of fragmentâprotein interactions in translational and rotational space is followed by de novo assembly of fragments into molecules and computation of binding free energies for the molecules with statistical mechanics. The rigorous sampling provides independence from the choice of initial binding pose and assembling fragments enables evaluation of binding of a large number of molecule poses with relatively little computation. The method allows a full sampling of possible conformations and avoids the âconformational focusingâ problem associated with free energy methods that sample only limited conformational and orientation changes from a starting pose. The direct computation of the entropy loss upon assembling fragments into molecules is an innovation for fragment-based methods. The computed binding free energies are compared to calorimetric data for a series of ligands for the T4 lysozyme {L99A} mutant and binding constants for a series of p38 {MAP} kinase ligands. In both cases, the standard error of prediction is close to 1 kcal/mol.},

We apply the method of "blocking Gibbs" sampling to a problem of great importance and complexity--linkage analysis. Blocking Gibbs sampling combines exact local computations with Gibbs sampling, in a way that complements the strengths of both.

New developments of the method are outlined, and it is applied to a highly complex linkage problem in a human pedigree.},

	title = {Bayes Factors},
	volume = {90},
	abstract = {In a 1935 paper and in his book Theory of Probability, Jeffreys developed a methodology for quantifying the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. The centerpiece was a number, now called the Bayes factor, which is the posterior odds of the null hypothesis when the prior probability on the null is one-half. Although there has been much discussion of Bayesian hypothesis testing in the context of criticism of P-values, less attention has been given to the Bayes factor as a practical tool of applied statistics. In this article we review and discuss the uses of Bayes factors in the context of five scientific applications in genetics, sports, ecology, sociology, and psychology. We emphasize the following points: From Jeffreys' Bayesian viewpoint, the purpose of hypothesis testing is to evaluate the evidence in favor of a scientific theory. Bayes factors offer a way of evaluating evidence in favor of a null hypothesis. Bayes factors provide a way of incorporating external information into the evaluation of evidence about a hypothesis. Bayes factors are very general and do not require alternative models to be nested. Several techniques are available for computing Bayes factors, including asymptotic approximations that are easy to compute using the output from standard packages that maximize likelihoods. In ''nonstandard'' statistical models that do not satisfy common regularity conditions, it can be technically simpler to calculate Bayes factor; than to derive {non-Bayesian} significance tests. The Schwarz criterion (or {BIG)} gives a rough approximation to the logarithm of the Bayes factor, which is easy to use and does not require evaluation of prior distributions. When one is interested in estimation or prediction, Bayes factors may be converted to weights to be attached to various models so that a composite estimate or prediction may be obtained that takes account of structural or model uncertainty. Algorithms have been proposed that allow model uncertainty to be taken into account when the class of models initially considered is very large. Bayes factors are useful for guiding an evolutionary model-building process. It is important, and feasible, to assess the sensitivity of conclusions to the prior distributions used.},

Methods of statistical analysis for lattice schemes are proposed, including a very flexible coding technique. The methods are illustrated by two numerical examples.

	abstract = {{"Grid"} computing has emerged as an important new field, distinguished from conventional distributed computing by its focus on large-scale resource sharing, innovative applications, and, in some cases, high performance orientation. In this article, the authors define this new field. First, they review the {"Grid} problem," which is defined as flexible, secure, coordinated resource sharing among dynamic collections of individuals, institutions, and resources--what is referred to as virtual organizations. In such settings, unique authentication, authorization, resource access, resource discovery, and other challenges are encountered. It is this class of problem that is addressed by Grid technologies. Next, the authors present an extensible and open Grid architecture, in which protocols, services, application programming interfaces, and software development kits are categorized according to their roles in enabling resource sharing. The authors describe requirements that they believe any such mechanisms must satisfy and discuss the importance of defining a compact set of intergrid protocols to enable interoperability among different Grid systems. Finally, the authors discuss how Grid technologies relate to other contemporary technologies, including enterprise integration, application service provider, storage service provider, and peer-to-peer computing. They maintain that Grid concepts and technologies complement and have much to contribute to these other approaches.},

	title = {A direct approach to conformational dynamics based on Hybrid Monte Carlo},
	volume = {151},
	abstract = {Recently, a novel concept for the computation of essential features of the dynamics of Hamiltonian systems (such as molecular dynamics) has been proposed. The realization of this concept had been based on subdivision techniques applied to the {Frobenius-Perron} operator for the dynamical system. The present paper suggests an alternative but related concept that merges the conceptual advantages of the dynamical systems approach with the appropriate statistical physics framework. This approach allows us to define the phrase âconformationâ in terms of the dynamical behavior of the molecular system and to characterize the dynamical stability of conformations. In a first step, the frequency of conformational changes is characterized in statistical terms leading to the definition of some Markov operator T that describes the corresponding transition probabilities within the canonical ensemble. In a second step, a discretization of T via specific hybrid Monte Carlo techniques is shown to lead to a stochastic matrix P. With these theoretical preparaions, an identification algorithm for conformations (to be presented in a later paper) is applicable. It is demonstrated that the discretization of T can be restricted to few essential degrees of freedom so that the combinatorial explosion of discretization boxes is prevented and biomolecular systems can be attacked. Numerical results for the n-pentane molecule and the triribonucleotide adenylyl(3'-5')cytidylyl(3'-5')cytidin are given and interpreted.},

In this way, kinetic data (like the rate constants and the transition path ensemble) and the underlying free-energy landscape (or probability distribution) of the system are obtained efficiently and concurrently. The applicability of these techniques is illustrated by studying several test systems, including two that involve potential energy surfaces having multiple metastable states and transition pathways, representative of complex kinetic behavior.},

	abstract = {We explored the possibility of improving the accuracy and precision of free-energy differences estimated via expanded ensembles by manipulation of the biasing weights. Three different weighing approaches were compared: the flat histogram {(FH)} method, the optimized ensemble {(OE)} method, and a method introduced in this work, denoted {MinVar,} which aims to explicitly minimize the expected variance. The performance of these three methods was tested for the simulation of chemical potentials in systems of symmetric diblock copolymers with chain lengths of either 10 or 4 beads, and a system of one large hard sphere of diameter 10d immersed in a fluid of hard spheres of diameter d. In addition, the effect of the weighing method on the observed accuracy was investigated for different choices of macrostate staging and for both optimized and nonoptimized acceptance ratio methods for calculating free-energy differences. In the diblock copolymer systems, we found that the maximum attainable accuracy can be limited by correlations between the samples, causing the ârealâ observed variances to be much larger than the expected âidealâ ones. Hence, if the formal minimization of the variance, as aimed by the {MinVar} method, occurs at the expense of increasing the correlations in the data, the accuracy may actually decrease. Although maximizing the number of round trips between initial and final macrostates (as aimed by the {OE} method) was found to be directly related to data decorrelation, this only translates into increased accuracy if the correlations are the major source of errors in the free energy estimates. Finally, for the hard sphere system, we found that the {MinVar} method performs better than both the {OE} and {FH} methods even though the {MinVar} method in this case never completes a round trip, illustrating that maximizing the number of round trips for fixed computational cost does not necessarily lead to increased precision.},

We find, first, good general agreement between the simulations and the experiments, with an rms error of 1.24 kcal/mol over the whole set (i.e., about 2 {kT)} and a correlation coefficient of 0.89. Second, we use an automated procedure to identify systematic errors for some classes of compounds and suggest some improvements to the force field. We find that alkyne hydration free energies are particularly poorly predicted due to problems with a {Lennard-Jones} well depth and find that an alternate choice for this well depth largely rectifies the situation. Third, we study the nonpolar component of hydration free energiesî¸that is, the part that is not due to electrostatics. While we find that repulsive and attractive components of the nonpolar part both scale roughly with surface area (or volume) of the solute, the total nonpolar free energy does not scale with the solute surface area or volume, because it is a small difference between large components and is dominated by the deviations from the trend. While the methods used here are not new, this is a more extensive test than previous explicit solvent studies, and the size of the test set allows identification of systematic problems with force field parameters for particular classes of compounds. We believe that the computed free energies and components will be valuable to others in the future development of force fields and solvation models.},

The {GROMACS} software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel {MD} and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in {ANSI} C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl).

Conversion programs between {GROMOS} and {GROMACS} formats are included. The {MD} program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and {Lennard-Jones} or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step. (19 refs.)},

A trend was observed toward greater diversity of color in designed libraries that better preserved fluorescence. Contrary to trends observed among libraries constructed by error-prone {PCR,} preservation of function was observed to increase with a library's average mutation level among the four libraries designed with structure-based computational methods.},

	abstract = {By considering all possible mutations among four para-substituted phenols, p-chlorophenol, p-methylphenol, p-cyanophenol, and p-methoxyphenol, which bind as inclusion compounds in alpha-cyclodextrin, the convergence properties of thermodynamic integration free energy calculations using slow growth as compared to numerical quadrature are investigated and interpreted in terms of structural and dynamical properties of the molecular system. It is shown that a systematic increase in the calculated hysteresis can be expected with increasing simulation time in slow-growth calculations if the system is perturbed faster than the rate at which the various states that make up the equilibrium ensemble are sampled. Using numerical quadrature the effects of nonequilibrium can be largely separated from the effects of insufficient sampling. It is shown, however, that the apparent degree of convergence when using numerical quadrature does not necessarily reflect the accuracy of the calculation. The utility of formulating closed cycles in both the bound and unbound states as a means of determining the minimum error in a given calculation is demonstrated. The effects of the choice of pathway and of the choice of integration scheme on convergence within closed cycles are also discussed. Finally, the quality of the force field used and the relative importance of the force field as opposed to sampling considerations are assessed by comparing the estimated free energy differences to experimental data. It is shown that a meaningful appraisal of a specific force field cannot be made independent of sampling considerations. A modification to the {GROMOS} force field that improved the agreement between the calculated and experimental free energies for the mutation of p-chlorophenol to p-methylphenol is also proposed.},

The complete sequence was determined with the aid of the statistical computational design algorithm {SCADS.} The 34-residue peptide was chemically synthesized. {UVvis} and {CD} spectroscopy, size-exclusion chromatography, and analytical ultracentrifugation indicated the peptide undergoes a transition from a predominantly random coil monomer to an alpha-helical tetramer upon binding {DPPFe(III).} {EPR} spectroscopy studies indicated the axial imidazole ligands were oriented in a perpendicular fashion, as defined by second-shell interactions that were included in the design. The {1-D} {1H} {NMR} spectrum of the assembled protein displayed features of a well-packed interior. The assembled protein possessed functional redox properties different from those of structurally similar systems containing the heme cofactor. The designed peptide demonstrated remarkable cofactor selectivity with a significantly weaker binding affinity for the natural heme cofactor.

	abstract = {Abstract: Fatty acid amide hydrolase {(FAAH)} is a serine hydrolase responsible for the degradation of anandamide, an endogenous cannabinoid agonist, and oleamide, a sleep-inducing lipid. Recently, Boger and co-workers reported a potent, selective, and efficacious class of reversible -ketoheterocycle inhibitors of {FAAH} that produce analgesia in animal models {(J.} Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 1849-1856; Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005, 15, 1423-1428). Key aspects of the structure-activity data are addressed here through computational analysis of {FAAH} inhibition using Monte Carlo {(MC)} simulations in conjunction with free energy perturbation {(FEP)} calculations. The {MC/FEP} simulations demonstrate that incorporation of pyridine at the C5 position of the 2-keto-oxazole and 2-keto-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives significantly enhances binding affinity by formation of a hydrogen-bonded array between the pyridyl nitrogen and Lys142 and Thr236. The results also attribute the activity boost upon substitution of oxazole by oxadiazole to reduced steric interactions in the active site and a lower torsional energy penalty upon binding.},

	abstract = {In molecular simulations with fixed-charge force fields, the choice of partial atomic charges influences numerous computed physical properties, including binding free energies. Many molecular mechanics force fields specify how nonbonded parameters should be determined, but various choices are often available for how these charges are to be determined for arbitrary small molecules. Here, we compute hydration free energies for a set of 44 small, neutral molecules in two different explicit water models {(TIP3P} and {TIP4P-Ew)} to examine the influence of charge model on agreement with experiment. Using the {AMBER} {GAFF} force field for nonbonded parameters, we test several different methods for obtaining partial atomic charges, including two fast methods exploiting semiempirical quantum calculations and methods deriving charges from the electrostatic potentials computed with several different levels of ab initio quantum calculations with and without a continuum reaction field treatment of solvent. We find that the best charge sets give a root-mean-square error from experiment of roughly 1 kcal/mol. Surprisingly, agreement with experimental hydration free energies does not increase substantially with increasing level of quantum theory, even when the quantum calculations are performed with a reaction field treatment to better model the aqueous phase. We also find that the semiempirical {AM1-BCC} method for computing charges works almost as well as any of the more computationally expensive ab initio methods and that the root-mean-square error reported here is similar to that for implicit solvent models reported in the literature. Further, we find that the discrepancy with experimental hydration free energies grows substantially with the polarity of the compound, as does its variation across theory levels.},

We show that a linear coupling scheme for the alchemical creation of a chemical identity corresponds to a particularly useful path because it leads to a symmetric decoupling of the free energy components.

	volume = {115},
	abstract = {We examine issues involved in applying and interpreting free-energy perturbation {(FEP)} calculations in molecular simulation, with the aim to develop simple heuristics that can guide their use and warn when a result is likely to be inaccurate. We build on the accuracy model developed in the first paper of this series {[N.} Lu and D. A. Kofke, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 7303 (2001)], which emphasized the sign of the entropy difference {(DeltaS)} between the target and reference systems as an essential indicator for the correct implementation of {FEP} calculations: such calculations must be performed in the 'insertion' direction, for which {DeltaS} {\textless}0, or else they are very likely to be systematically incorrect (i.e., inaccurate). We describe here an extended analysis for insertion {FEP} calculations, and identify the group M {exp(DeltaS/k),} where M is the number of independent {FEP} samples taken and k is Boltzmann's constant, as a relevant quantity for characterizing the accuracy of {FEP} result. We find that if M {exp(DeltaS/k)} is of order 100 or larger, then one can expect the {FEP} calculation to yield a result of minimally acceptable accuracy; for a margin of safety a value of 1000 or greater is preferable for this group. Although the {FEP-measured} {DeltaS} is required to apply this heuristic, it is 'safe' in that any inaccuracy in this {DeltaS} will be such that the group M {exp(DeltaS/k)} is even smaller than it is for the true {DeltaS,} and will therefore still warn of an inaccurate result. The analysis is demonstrated for a very wide range of {DeltaS} values, considering a model {FEP} calculation, a hard-sphere insertion calculation, and a diameter-change {FEP} in the {Lennard-Jones} model. We apply the results of this analysis, and earlier work, to consider the question of the optimal number of intermediate stages to use in a staged {FEP} calculation. The analysis shows that, for optimal accuracy, stages should be selected such that the entropy difference per stage satisfies {DeltaS/k=-1;} however, consideration of the precision instead prescribes that {DeltaS/k=-2.} Inasmuch as the precision is the larger concern once accuracy reaches an acceptable level, the latter criterion forms our recommendation for selecting the number of intermediate stages. {(C)} 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

We have determined the structure of wild-type {HIV-1} {RT} complexed with {TMC278} at 1.8 angstrom resolution, using an {RT} crystal form engineered by systematic {RT} mutagenesis. This high-resolution structure reveals that the cyanovinyl group of {TMC278} is positioned in a hydrophobic tunnel connecting the {NNRTI-binding} pocket to the nucleic acid-binding cleft. The crystal structures of {TMC278} in complexes with the double mutant {K103N/Y181C} (2.1 angstrom) and {L1001/K103N} {HIV-1} {RTs} (2.9 angstrom) demonstrated that {TMC278} adapts to bind mutant {RTs.} In the {K103N/Y181C} {RT/TMC278} structure, loss of the aromatic ring interaction caused by the {Y181C} mutation is counterbalanced by interactions between the cyanovinyl group of {TMC278} and the aromatic side chain of Y183, which is facilitated by an similar to 1.5 angstrom shift of the conserved {Y183MDD} motif. In the {L1001/K103N} {RT/TMC278} structure, the binding mode of {TMC278} is significantly altered so that the drug conforms to changes in the binding pocket primarily caused by the L1001 mutation. The flexible binding pocket acts as a molecular "shrink wrap" that makes a shape complementary to the optimized {TMC278} in wild-type and drug-resistant forms of {HIV-1} {RT.} The crystal structures provide a better understanding of how the flexibility of an inhibitor can compensate for drug-resistance mutations.},

Results show that at low temperature. where the harmonic approximation holds, the {Nose'-Hoover} {(NH)} thermostat fails to reproduce the statistical mechanical behavior, even using simulation lengths of millions of time steps, whereas the Gaussian isokinetic {(IG)} thermostat reproduces quite well the expected statistical mechanical values. The Berendsen's coupling {(BC)} provides good results for basic properties such as the average potential and kinetic energies but fails in reproducing the canonical fluctuations. Moreover, using the speed of divergence of initially nearby trajectories in phase space as a measure of the dynamical chaoticity, we found that the {NH} thermostat provides very slow divergence for the physical phase space degrees of freedom, concentrating most of its chaoticity in the dynamics of the thermostat virtual degree of freedom. On the contrary, the {IG} thermostat provides always highly diverging trajectories in phase space, characterized by a high chaoticity of each degree of freedom. Finally, the {BC} thermostat provides a moderate chaotic behavior for all of the degrees of freedom. Such results suggest that even assuming for both the ârigorousâ algorithms {(NH} and {IG)} a full ergodic behavior the {NH} thermostat could require an extremely long time to achieve convergence of the time averaged properties. {KeyWords} Plus: {MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS;} {HAMILTONIAN-SYSTEMS;} {CANONICAL} {ENSEMBLE;} {SIMULATIONS;} {EQUILIBRIUM;} {ERGODICITY;} {PROTEINS;} {FREEDOM;} {ALKANES;} {TIMES}},

	doi = {10.1021/jp072761v},
	abstract = {Abstract: In this paper, the implementation of the {CS-FE/MT} model introduced in article 1 is discussed, and computer simulations are performed to evaluate the feasibility of the new theoretical approach. As discussed in article 1, making predictions of surfactant/solubilizate aqueous solution behavior using the {CS-FE/MT} model requires evaluation of G for multiple surfactant-to-solubilizate or surfactant-to-cosurfactant transformations. The central goal of this article is to evaluate the quantitative accuracy of the alchemical computer simulation method used in the {CS-FE/MT} modeling approach to predict G for a single surfactant-to-solubilizate or for a single surfactant-to-cosurfactant transformation. A hybrid single/dual topology approach was used to morph the ionic surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate {(SDS)} into the ionic solubilizate ibuprofen {(IBU),} and a dual topology approach was used to morph the nonionic surfactant octyl glucoside {(OG)} into the nonionic solubilizate p-aminobenzoate {(PAB).} In addition, a single topology approach was used to morph the nonionic surfactant n-decyl dimethylphosphine oxide {(C10PO)} into the nonionic cosurfactant n-decyl methyl sulfoxide {(C10SO),} the nonionic surfactant octylsulfinyl ethanol {(C8SE)} into the nonionic cosurfactant decylsulfinyl ethanol {(C10SE),} and the nonionic surfactant n-decyl methyl sulfoxide {(C10SO)} into the nonionic cosurfactant n-octyl methyl sulfoxide {(C8SO).} Each G value was computed by using thermodynamic integration to determine the difference in free energy associated with (i) transforming a surfactant molecule of type A into a cosurfactant/solubilizate molecule of type B in a micellar environment (referred to as G2) and (ii) transforming a surfactant molecule of type A into a cosurfactant/solubilizate molecule of type B in aqueous solution (referred to as G1). {CS-FE/MT} model predictions of G for each alchemical transformation were made at a number of simulation conditions, including (i) different equilibration times at each value of the coupling parameter , (ii) different data-gathering times at each value, and (iii) simulation at a different number of values. For the three surfactant-to-cosurfactant transformations considered here, the G values predicted by the {CS-FE/MT} model were compared with G values predicted by an accurate molecular thermodynamic {(MT)} model developed by fitting to experimental {CMC} data. Even after performing lengthy equilibration and data gathering at each value, physically unrealistic values of G were predicted by the {CS-FE/MT} model for the transformations of {SDS} into {IBU} and of {OG} into {PAB.} However, more physically realistic G values were predicted for the transformation of {C10PO} into {C10SO,} and reasonable free-energy predictions were obtained for the transformations of {C8SE} into {C10SE} and {C10SO} into {C8SO.} Each of the surfactant-to-cosurfactant transformations considered here involved less extensive structural changes than the surfactant-to-solubilizate transformations. As computer power increases and as improvements are made to alchemical free-energy methods, it may become possible to apply the {CS-FE/MT} model to make accurate predictions of the free-energy changes associated with forming multicomponent surfactant and solubilizate micelles in aqueous solution where the chemical structures of the surfactants, cosurfactants, and solubilizates differ significantly.},

By eliminating the high frequencies, longer time steps can be achieved in equilibrium and refinement (non-equilibrium) simulations, sometimes at the expense of decreasing physical correctness of the simulated system. The different force field terms used in molecular simulations can be constrained or softened leading to a maximum time step of 5 fs for a simulation, in which static equilibrium properties are not affected by the changes in the force field parameters introduced, but dynamical quantities are. Using a very smoothed, soft interaction function and increased hydrogen masses, a time step of 14 fs can be reached. However, it should only be used in refinement simulations, in which the unphysical properties of the force field and dynamics are of minor importance.},

However, many effective drugs act via modulation of multiple proteins rather than single targets. Advances in systems biology are revealing a phenotypic robustness and a network structure that strongly suggests that exquisitely selective compounds, compared with multitarget drugs, may exhibit lower than desired clinical efficacy. This new appreciation of the role of polypharmacology has significant implications for tackling the two major sources of attrition in drug development - efficacy and toxicity. Integrating network biology and polypharmacology holds the promise of expanding the current opportunity space for druggable targets. However, the rational design of polypharmacology faces considerable challenges in the need for new methods to validate target combinations and optimize multiple structure-activity relationships while maintaining drug-like properties. Advances in these areas are creating the foundation of the next paradigm in drug discovery: network pharmacology.},

	abstract = {Docking of {FK506,} rapamycin, and L-685,818 into their receptor, {FKBP12,} suggests that unlike the respective structures determined by X-ray crystallography, the uncomplexed {FKBP12} structures determined by {NMR} may not be directly usable to ident ify high affinity ligands by docking studies for computational drug screening. In view of the resolution of the experimentally determined structures of {FKBP12} and relatively small difference of the receptor binding sites between the complexed and uncomple xed stares, it is unclear if the conformational induction mechanism is relevant to the binding of {FKBP12} with its ligands. Alternatively, we advocate a conformation selection mechanism fundamentally akin to a mechanism proposed by Burgen. This mechanism b etter explains the experimental and calculated results for the binding of {FKBP12} with {FK506.} It emphasizes that both guest and host select their most compatible preformed conformers to effect binding, and that the observed free energy of binding is a sum of the free energy change in complexation of the two most compatible conformers and the free energy changes in conversion of the Boltzmann-weighted principal conformers to the most compatible conformers. Conceptually, this mechanism represents one physica l or nonphysical path of a thermodynamic cycle that is closed by the other path represented by the conformational induction mechanism, which can also be physical or nonphysical; it provides a theoretical means to estimate the affinity of the guest to the host with the experimentally available {3D} structures of the two partners.},

Precise values of the Gibbs free energy of transfer were calculated directly from the ratio of the solute number densities in the two co-existing phases. It is observed that the {OPLS} force field yields Gibbs free energies of transfer that are in qualitative, albeit not quantitative, agreement with experimental results. Comparison of the partitioning between a helium vapor and dryer wet 1-octanol phases established that water saturation affects mostly the partitioning of polar solutes, while differences for alkane partitioning were found to be negligible. In addition, the analysis of radial distribution functions of alcohol solutes in wet 1-octanol shows preferential partitioning into water-rich regions of the microheterogeneous solvent mixture.},

Intriguingly, growth inhibition or even complete loss of bacterial viability is often the result of a cascade of events elicited upon treatment with an antibacterial agent. In addition, their mode of action frequently involves more than one single target. A comprehensive description of the targets exploited so far by commercialized antibacterial agents, including anti-mycobacterial agents, is given. The number of targets exploited so far by commercial antibacterial agents is estimated to be about 40. The most important biosynthetic pathways and cellular structures affected by antibacterial drugs are the cell wall biosynthesis, protein biosynthesis, {DNA} per se, replication, {RNA} per se, transcription and the folate biosynthetic pathway. The disillusionment with the genomics driven antibacterial drug discovery is a result of the restrictive definition of targets as products of essential and conserved genes. Emphasis is made to not only focus on proteins as potential drug targets, but increase efforts and devise screening technologies to discover new agents interacting with different {RNA} species, {DNA,} new protein families or macromolecular complexes of these constituents.},

	abstract = {Hydration of protein cavities influences protein stability, dynamics, and function. Protein active sites usually contain water molecules that, upon ligand binding, are either displaced into bulk solvent or retained to mediate protein-ligand interactions. The contribution of water molecules to ligand binding must be accounted for to compute accurate values of binding affinities. This requires estimation of the extent of hydration of the binding site. However, it is often difficult to identify the water molecules involved in the binding process when ligands bind on the surface of a protein. Cytochrome P450cam is, therefore, an ideal model system because its substrate binds in a buried active site, displacing partially disordered solvent, and the protein is well characterized experimentally. We calculated the free energy differences for having five to eight water molecules in the active site cavity of the unliganded enzyme from molecular dynamics simulations by thermodynamic integration employing a three-stage perturbation scheme. The computed free energy differences between the hydration states are small (within 12 {kJ} mol-1) but distinct. Consistent with the crystallographic determination and studies employing hydrostatic pressure, we calculated that, although ten water molecules could in principle occupy the volume of the active site, occupation by five to six water molecules is thermodynamically most favorable.

	abstract = {In this work, eight different scoring functions have been combined with the aim of improving I the prediction of protein-ligand binding conformations and affinities. The obtained scores were analyzed using multivariate statistical methods to generate expressions,,with the ability (1) to select the best candidate between different docked conformations of an inhibitor {(MultiSelect)} and (2) to quantify the protein-ligand binding affinity {(MultiScore).} By use of the docking program {GOLD,} 40 different inhibitors were docked into the active site of three matrix metalloproteinases {(MMP's),} yielding a total of 120 enzyme-inhibitor complexes. For each complex, a single conformation of the inhibitor was selected using principal component analysis {(PCA)} for the scores obtained by the eight functions {SCORE,} {LUDI,} {GRID,} {PMF\_Score,} {D\_Score,} {G\_Score,} {ChemScore,} and {F\_Score.} Binding affinities were estimated based on partial least-squares projections onto latent structures {(PLS)} on the eight scores of each se lected: inhibitor conformation. By use of this procedure, R-2 = 0.78 and Q(2) = 0.78 were obtained when comparing experimental and calculated binding affinities. {MultiSelect} was evaluated by applying the same method for selecting docked conformations for 18 different protein-ligand;complexes of known three-dimensional structure. In all cases, the selected ligand conformations were found to be very similar to the experimentally determined ligand conformations. A more general evaluation of {MultiScore} was pe rformed using a set of 120 different protein-ligand complexes for which both the three-dimensional structures and the binding affinities were known. This approach: allowed an evaluation of {MultiScore} independently of {MultiSelect.} The generality of the met hod was verified by obtaining Q(2) = 0.68 and Q(2) = 0.67, when comparing calculated and experimental binding affinities for the 120 X-ray structures. In all cases, {LUDI,} {SCORE,} {GRID,} and {F\_Score} were included as important functions, whereas the fifth fun ction was {PMF\_Score} and {ChemScore} for the {MMP} and X-ray models, respectively.},

To further reduce the computational cost, the adequate non-uniform intervals of coupling constant [lambda], connecting two equilibrium states, namely bound and unbound, are determined. The absolute binding energies {[Delta]G} thus obtained have effective linear relation between the computed and experimental values.

Comparisons with published and new canonical {MP2} calculations on the alanine dipeptide are made. Results for ten gas-phase tetrapeptide conformations and a beta-sheet dipeptide dimer are compared with 20 different molecular mechanics force field parametrizations, providing the first assessment of the reliability of these models for systems larger than a dipeptide. Comparisons are made with the {LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-f)} results, which are taken as a benchmark for the tetrapeptides. Statistical summaries with regard to energetics and structure are produced for each farce field, and a discussion of qualitative successes and failures is provided. The results display both the successes and limitations of the force fields studied and can be used as benchmark data in the development of new and improved force fields. In particular, comparisons of hydrogen-bonding energetics as a function of geometry suggest that future force fields will need to employ a representation for electrostatics that goes beyond the use of atom-centered partial charges.},

	abstract = {A modified thermodynamic integration technique is presented to obtain free energy differences from molecular dynamics simulations. In this multiconfiguration thermodynamic integration technique, the commonly employed single configuration (slow growth) approximation is not made. It is shown, by analysis of the sources of error, how the multiconfiguration variant of thermodynamic integration allows for a soundly based assessment of the statistical error in the evaluated free energy difference. Since ensembles of configurations are generated for each integration step, a statistical error can be evaluated for each integration step. By generating ensembles of different lengths, the statistical error can be equally distributed over the integration. This eliminates the difficult problem in single configuration thermodynamic integrations of determining the best rate of change of the Hamiltonian, which is usually based on equally distributing the free energy change. At the same time, this procedure leads to a more efficient use of computer time by providing the possibility of added accuracy from separate calculations of the same Hamiltonian change. The technique is applied to a simple but illustrative model system consisting of a monatomic solute in aqueous solution. In a second example, a combination of multiconfiguration thermodynamic integration and thermodynamic perturbation is used to obtain the potentials of mean force for rotation of the sidechain dihedral angles for valine and threonine dipeptides with restrained backbones in aqueous solution.},

Short bursts of appropriately initialized simulations are used to infer the deterministic and stochastic components of the peptide motion parametrized by an appropriate set of coarse variables. Techniques from traditional numerical analysis {(Newton-Raphson,} coarse projective integration) are thus enabled; these techniques help analyze important features of the free-energy landscape (coarse transition states, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, transition rates, etc.). Reverse integration of coarse variables backward in time can assist escape from free energy minima and trace low-dimensional free energy surfaces. To illustrate the coarse molecular dynamics approach, we combine multiple short (0.5 ps) replica simulations to map the free energy surface of the âalanine dipeptideâ in water, and to determine the similar to1/(1000 ps) rate of interconversion between the two stable configurational basins corresponding to the alpha-helical and extended minima.},

	abstract = {Errors in free energies for molecular replacement and for conformation change of a small model peptide have been determined empirically by repeated simulations from different starting points. All calculations have been done using thermodynamic integration, in which the system's potential energy is coupled to a parameter-lambda that is increased or decreased by a small amount at each step of the simulation. The effects of several factors that may alter the precision are evaluated. These factors include: the length of the simulation, the dependence of the potential energy on lambda, the use of conformational restraints, and their magnitude and form. The methods used for restraint and conformational forcing are described in detail. The free energy change, calculated as the mean from several successive simulations with alternately increasing and decreasing-lambda, is found to be independent of the length of the simulations. As expected, longer simulations produce more precise results. The variation of the calculated free energies is found to consist of two parts, a random error and a systematic hysteresis, i.e., a dependence on the direction in which lambda-changes. The hysteresis varies as the inverse of the length of the simulation and the random error as the inverse square root. The advantage of the use of a different (nonlinear) dependence of the attractive and repulsive parts of the nonbonded potential energy on the coupling parameter when 'creating' particles in solution is found to be very large. This nonlinear coupling was found to be superior to the use of linear coupling and a nonlinear change of the coupling parameter with the simulation time. The hysteresis in conformational free energy calculations is found to increase markedly if too weak a forcing restraint is chosen. It is shown how to deconvolute the contribution of a torsional restraint from the dependence of the free energy on a torsion angle.},

	abstract = {Recently, we developed an efficient free energy simulation technique, the simulated scaling {(SS)} method {[H.} Li , J. Chem. Phys. 126, 024106 (2007)], in the framework of generalized ensemble simulations. In the {SS} simulations, random walks in the scaling parameter space are realized so that both phase space overlap sampling and conformational space sampling can be simultaneously enhanced. To flatten the distribution in the scaling parameter space, in the original {SS} implementation, the {Wang-Landau} recursion was employed due to its well-known recursion capability. In the {Wang-Landau} recursion based {SS} free energy simulation scheme, at the early stage, recursion efficiencies are high and free energy regions are quickly located, although at this stage, the errors of estimated free energy values are large; at the later stage, the errors of estimated free energy values become smaller, however, recursions become increasingly slow and free energy refinements require very long simulation time. In order to robustly resolve this efficiency problem during free energy refinements, a hybrid recursion strategy is presented in this paper. Specifically, we let the {Wang-Landau} update method take care of the early stage recursion: the location of target free energy regions, and let the adaptive reweighting method take care of the late stage recursion: the refinements of free energy values. As comparably studied in the model systems, among three possible recursion procedures, the adaptive reweighting recursion approach is the least favorable one because of its low recursion efficiency during free energy region locations; and compared to the original {Wang-Landau} recursion approach, the proposed hybrid recursion technique can be more robust to guarantee free energy simulation efficiencies. {(C)} 2008 American Institute of Physics.},

The method, {CONCEPTS} {(Creation} of Novel Compounds by Evaluation of Particles at Target Sites), places a group of atom-like particles in the site. The p articles are free to move within the site to improve binding to the protein. A key innovation of this technique is that covalent connections are made among the particles in a stochastic and dynamically reversible manner. These changes in the topology are either accepted or rejected depending on their ability to improve the total energy of the enzyme-inhibitor complex. The method is applied to two test systems: The {FK506} binding protein {(FKBP-12)} and {HIV-1} aspartyl protease. In both cases, we are able to p redict, de novo, drugs that have striking similarities to known potent inhibitors and that can successfully be used to generate âhitsâ of the known inhibitors from a data base. {(C)} 1993 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

The response is to a âcontrol termâ added as a modification to the master equation for statistical distributions. The proof of the relations is based upon a variational characterization of the generating functional of the time correlations. The same fluctuation-response relations are preserved within moment closures for the statistical dynamical system, when these are constructed via the variational {Rayleigh-Ritz} procedure. For the two-time correlations of the moment variables themselves, the fluctuation-response relation is equivalent to an {âOnsager} regression hypothesisâ for the small fluctuations. For correlations of higher order, there is a further effect in addition to such linear propagation of fluctuations present instantaneously: the dynamical generation of correlations by nonlinear interaction of fluctuations. In general, we discuss some physical and mathematical aspects of the Ansatze required for an accurate calculation of the time correlations. We also comment briefly upon the computational use of these relations, which is well suited for automatic differentiation tools. An example will be given of a simple closure for turbulent energy decay, which illustrates the numerical application of the relations.},

The {MM-PBSA} free energy analysis provides a reasonable absolute binding free energy for the {RNA} aptamer-theophylline complex formation. Energetic analysis reveals that the van der Waals interaction and the nonpolar contribution to solvation provide the basis for the favorable absolute free energy of complex. This trend is similar to other protein-ligand interactions studied previously. The {MM-PBSA} method also ranks the relative binding energies of five theophylline analogs approximately correctly, but not as well as the more conventional thermodynamic integration calculations, which were carried out to convert theophylline into its analogs. The comparison of {MM-PBSA} with {TI} suggests that the {MM-PBSA} method has some difficulties with the first-solvation-shell energetics. {\textbackslash}copyright 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

It introduces a bias factor in Monte Carlo simulations or, equivalently, a bias force in molecular dynamics simulations. The bias factor targets the energy gap, i.e., the difference in energy function between two states, and is therefore specifically designed for calculating free-energy differences. The goal is to make the probability density of the energy gap as uniform as possible, thus allowing for its accurate determination. An iterative procedure, based on simulations at higher temperatures, is devised to obtain the bias factor. The same method naturally extends to the calculation of potentials of mean force. The generalized coordinate, for which the potential of mean force is to be calculated, now plays the role of the energy gap. Applications to model systems confirm the expected increase in accuracy of calculated free-energy differences and potentials of mean force.},

Various statistical, informatics and filtering methods have recently been introduced to foster the integration of experimental and in silico screening and maximize their output in drug discovery. Although many of these ideas and efforts have not yet proceeded much beyond the conceptual level, there are several success stories and good indications that early-stage drug discovery will benefit greatly from a more unified and knowledge-based approach to biological screening, despite the many technical advances towards even higher throughput that are made in the screening arena.},

At its introduction in 1981, the {QH} method was successfully applied to simple molecular systems with only one highly occupied energy well, and fluctuations were analyzed in a system of internal bond-angle-torsion coordinates. However, more recent studies have applied the {QH} method to complex biomolecular systems and have relied upon Cartesian coordinates. The present study evaluates the accuracy of the {QH} method through comparisons with more detailed methods. The chief findings are that the {QH} method can markedly overestimate the configurational entropy for systems with multiple occupied energy wells and that such errors tend to be magnified by the use of Cartesian coordinates instead of bond-angle-torsion coordinates.},

The model utilizes the Buckingham exponential-6 potential to describe the nonbonded interaction energy. Histogram reweighting grand canonical Monte Carlo methods were used to determine the model parameters. The new model reproduces the experimental saturated liquid and vapor densities and vapor pressures for ethane through octane to within average absolute deviations of 0.5\%, 2.1\%, and 2.2\% respectively. Critical temperatures and densities were also found to be in good agreement with experiment. Critical pressures are slightly overestimated for longer chain lengths. Comparisons were made to the {TraPPE} {[J.} Phys. Chem. B 1998, 102, 2569.] and {NERD} {[J.} Chern. Phys. 1998, 108, 9905.] models. The two previous models reproduce the liquid properties with comparable accuracy to the proposed model; however, the new model was found to describe the vapor pressures more accurately. Liquid densities were determined for the new model for chain lengths as long as C-78 Agreement to experiment is within 1\% at atmospheric pressure. Phase diagrams were calculated for mixtures of ethane-heptane, ethane-decane, ethane-eicosane, and octane-dodecane. The new model achieves near-experimental predictive accuracy for these mixtures.},

	abstract = {Solvation free energy is an important molecular characteristic useful in drug discovery because it represents the desolvation cost of a ligand binding to a receptor. Most of the recent developments in the estimation of solvation free energy require the use of molecular mechanics and dynamics calculations. Group contribution methods have been rarely used in the past for calculating salvation free energy because automated prediction methods have not been developed in this regard. As an aid to combinatorial library design, we explored rapid and accurate means of computing salvation free energies from the covalent structures of organic molecules and compared the results on a test set with the {GB/SA} solvation model.. Two independent additive-constitutive {QSPR} methods have been developed for the computation of solvation free energy. The first is a {QSPR} model {(HLOGS)} derived using a technique that uses the counts of distinct/similar fragments and substructures for each molecule as variables in a {PLS} regression. The second method {(ALOGS)} uses an extensive atom classification scheme developed earlier for the calculation of Log P. A database of 265 molecules with experimentally determined salvation free energies is used to derive the {HLOGS} (r = 0.97; rms = 0.58) and {ALOGS} (r = 0.98; rms = 0.38) models, which were then tested on 27 molecules not present in the training set. A detailed comparison of the {HLOGS,} {ALOGS,} {GB/SA} (with {AMBER*} and {OPLSA*} potentials) on the test set showed that the {HLOGS} and {ALOGS} models give better results than the {GB/SA} model. Among the three methods tested, the {ALOGS} method gives the best result on the test set (r = 0.96; rms = 0.86), though the parametrization for this method is incomplete as many atom types are undetermined due to their absence in the current training set. The {HLOGS} method appears to handle intramolecular interactions better than the {ALOGS} method.},

Use of B-splines in place of Lagrange interpolation leads to analytic gradients as well as a significant improvement in the accuracy. We demonstrate that arbitrary accuracy can be achieved, independent of system size N, at a cost that scales as N {log(N).} For biomolecular systems with many thousands of atoms this method permits the use of Ewald summation at a computational cost comparable to that of a simple truncation method of 10 {AA} or less.

The different force field terms used in molecular simulations can be constrained or softened leading to a maximum time step of 5 fs for a simulation, in which static equilibrium properties are not affected by the changes in the force field parameters introduced, but dynamical quantities are. Using a very smoothed, soft interaction function and increased hydrogen masses, a time step of 14 fs can be reached.

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations based on the replica-exchange framework {(REMD)} are emerging as a useful tool to characterize the conformational variability that is intrinsic to most chemical and biological systems. In this work, it is shown that a simple extension of the replica-exchange method, known as Hamiltonian {REMD,} greatly facilitates the characterization of conformational equilibria across large energetic barriers, or in the presence of substantial entropic effects, overcoming some of the difficulties of {REMD} based on temperature alone. In particular, a comparative assessment of the {HREMD} and {TREMD} approaches was made, through computation of the gas-phase free-energy difference between the so-called D2d and S4 states of tetrabutylammonium {(TBA),} an ionic compound of frequently used in biophysical studies of ion channels. Taking advantage of the greater efficiency of the {HREMD} scheme, the conformational equilibrium of {TBA} was characterized in a variety of conditions. Simulation of the gas-phase equilibrium in the 100-300 K range allowed us to compute the entropy difference between these states as well as to describe its temperature dependence. Through {HREMD} simulations of {TBA} in a water droplet, the effect of solvation on the conformational equilibrium was determined. Finally, the equilibrium of {TBA} in the context of a simplified model of the binding cavity of the {KcsA} potassium channel was simulated, and density maps for D2d and S4 states analogous to those derived from X-ray crystallography were constructed. Overall, this work illustrates the potential of the {HREMD} approach in the context of computational drug design, ligand-receptor structural prediction and more generally, molecular recognition, where one of the most challenging issues remains to account for conformational flexibility as well for the solvation and entropic effects thereon.},

The relat- ive mobilities of the ligands in their bound and free forms indicate a larger entropic penalty for distamycin when binding to the minor groove compared with net- ropsin, partially explaining the lower binding affinity of the distamycin molecule.

We present a novel approach to optimize {L-J} parameters via the use of ab initio data on interactions between rare gas atoms and model compounds combined with the reproduction of experimental pure solvent properties. Relative values of ab initio minimum interaction energies and geometries between helium or neon and model compounds were used to optimize the relative magnitude of the {L-T} parameters. Absolute values of the {L-J} parameters were determined by reproducing experimental heats of vaporization and molecular volumes for pure solvents. Application of the approach was performed on methane ethane, and propane. Free energies of aqueous solvation and butane pure solvent and aqueous solvation calculations were used to test the developed {L-J} parameters. The new alkane parameters are similar or improved as compared with current empirical force field parameters with respect to experimental pure solvent properties and free energies of aqueous solvation. Also included is a description of the internal portion of the force field. {(C)} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	volume = {33},
	abstract = {An extension to the configurational-bias Monte Carlo method is presented which allows for the efficient conformational sampling of the interior segments of chain molecules whose interactions include strong bonded terms (governing bond stretching, bond angle bending, and dihedral angle rotation). The ability to regrow interior segments overcomes the limitations of conventional configurational-bias methods (where the regrowth is always directed to a free chain end) and now allows for the simulation of chain systems with low concentrations of chain ends, that is, higher molecular weights, networks, or cyclic structures. As previously proposed by Dijkstra et al. {[J.} Chem. Phys. 1994, 101, 3179] for lattice polymers and by Vendruscolo {[J.} Chem. Phys. 1997, 106, 2970] for freely jointed polymers, an additional biasing (closing) probability is used that guides the bead-by-bead configurational-bias regrowth of interior segments toward its desired fixed target. However, while the previous methods are limited to chain models for which the number of random walks that lead to closure is known or which rely on simpler and less efficient geometric considerations, the algorithm presented here allows for the simulation of chain molecules using force fields of arbitrary complexity for which the closing probability is not known a priori. It is important to note that the additional biasing probability used to guide the move does not necessarily have to be the true closing probability but that a good approximation thereof is essential to improve the sampling efficiency. To this extent, we obtain an intial guess of the biasing probability from a short presimulation or an earlier simulation of a related system or simply use a uniform biasing probability. A self-adapting scheme is then used to optimize the biasing probability during the course of the simulation for the system of interest. In addition to the conformational sampling of interior segments, the new algorithm also enables efficient particle insertions and removals of cyclic molecules (of moderate length) and thereby opens the door to simulations in the grand canonical and Gibbs ensembles. Simulation results are presented for linear, branched, and cyclic alkanes using the transferable, potentials for phase equilibria {(TraPPE)} force field.},

	volume = {25},
	copyright = {(c)2004 Institute for Scientific Information, Inc.},
	abstract = {A fluctuating charge {(FQ)} force field is applied to molecular dynamics simulations for six small proteins in explicit polarizable solvent represented by the {TIP4P-FQ} potential. The proteins include {1FSV,} {1ENH,} {1PGB,} {1VII,} {1H8K,} and {1CRN,} representing both helical and beta-sheet secondary structural elements. Constant pressure and temperature {(NPT)} molecular dynamics simulations are performed on time scales of several nanoseconds, the longest simulations yet reported using explicitly polarizable all-atom empirical potentials (for both solvent and protein) in the condensed phase. In terms of structure, the {FQ} force field allows deviations from native structure up to 2.5 Angstrom (with a range of 1.0 to 2.5 Angstrom). This is commensurate to the performance of the {CHARMM22} nonpolarizable model and other currently existing polarizable models. Importantly, secondary structural elements maintain native structure in general to within 1 Angstrom (both helix and beta-strands), again in good agreement with the nonpolarizable case. In qualitative agreement with {QM/MM} ab initio dynamics on crambin {(Liu} et al. Proteins 2001, 44, 484), there is a sequence dependence of average condensed phase atomic charge for all proteins, a dependence one would anticipate considering the differing chemical environments around individual atoms; this is a subtle quantum mechanical feature captured in the {FQ} model but absent in current state-of-the-art nonpolarizable models. Furthermore, there is a mutual polarization of solvent and protein in the condensed phase. Solvent dipole moment distributions within the first and second solvation shells around the protein display a shift towards higher dipole moments (increases on the order of 0.2-0.3 Debye) relative to the bulk; protein polarization is manifested via the enhanced condensed phase charges of typical polar atoms such as backbone carbonyl oxygens, amide nitrogens, and amide hydrogens. Finally, to enlarge the sample set of proteins, gas-phase minimizations and 1 ps constant temperature simulations are performed on various-sized proteins to compare to earlier work by Kaminsky et al. {(J} Comp Chem 2002, 23, 1515). The present work establishes the feasibility of applying a fully polarizable force field for protein simulations and demonstrates the approach employed in extending the {CHARMM} force field to include these effects. {(C)} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The feasibility of this approach is evaluated here, combining {QM/MM} with the {Poisson-Boltzmann/surface} area model of continuum solvation and testing the method on a set of 47 benzamidine derivatives binding to trypsin. The experimental range of the absolute binding energy {(G} = -3.9 to -7.6 kcal/mol) is reproduced well, with a root-mean-square {(RMS)} error of 1.2 kcal/mol. When {QM/MM} is applied without reoptimization to the very different ligands of {FK506} binding protein the {RMS} error is only 0.7 kcal/mol. The results show that {QM/MM} is a promising new avenue for automated docking and scoring of flexible ligands. Suggestions are made for further improvements in accuracy.},

Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006, 346, 810-818). In the present study, random mutagenesis was used to improve the activity of this mutant. With three generations of error-prone {PCR,} mutants were obtained with 200-fold increased turnover toward drug substrates dextromethorphan and 3,4-methylenedioxymethylamphetamine. The initial activities of these mutants were up to 90-fold higher than that of human P450 {2D6.} These highly active drug metabolizing enzymes have great potential for biotechnology. Using sequencing analysis, the mutations responsible for the increase in activity were determined. The mutations that had the greatest effects on the activity were {F81I,} {E267V,} and particularly {L86I,} which is not located in the active site. Computer modeling studies were used to rationalize the effects of the mutations. This study shows that random mutagenesis can be used to identify novel critical residues, and to increase our insight into P450s.},

Structures were calculated by several different methods, including distance geometry, restrained mo lecular dynamics, and molecular dynamics with time-averaged restraints. The {NMR} structures of the ligand are very well defined by the {NOE} restraints and differ slightly from the X-ray structure in regions that are involved in crystal packing. Comparison w ith the {NMR} structure of {FK506} bound to wild-type {FKBP-12} reveals that the {R42K,} {H87V} mutation causes the ligand backbone near C16 to move by 2.5 to 4.5 Angstrom, reorients {15-MeO} by 90 degrees, and shifts {13-MeO} by approximately 1.5 Angstrom. {FK506} appea rs to undergo a concerted, mutationally induced shift in the binding pocket, with the greatest changes occurring in the effector region of the drug.

However, techniques that push the boundaries of chemical space could lead to many false positives or inhibitors that lack specificity for the target. Is it possible to broadly identify the appropriate chemical space for the inhibitors and yet maintain target specificity? To address this question, we have turned to dihydrofolate reductase {(DHFR),} a well-studied metabolic enzyme of pharmacological relevance. We have extended our multiple protein structure {(MPS)} method for receptor-based pharmacophore models to use multiple X-ray crystallographic structures. Models were created for {DHFR} from human and Pneumocystis carinii. These models incorporate a fair degree of protein flexibility and are highly selective for known {DHFR} inhibitors over drug-like non-inhibitors. Despite sharing a highly conserved active site, the pharmacophore models reflect subtle differences between the human and P. carinii fo...},

By increasing the van der Waals well depth epsilon from 0.152 kcal/mol for the {TIP3P} model to 0.190 kcal/mol (model {TLP3PMOD)} the solvation free energy of all-atom methane changed from 2.5 kcal/mol to 2.1 kcal/mol, much closer to the experimental value of 2.0 kcal/mol. This change of van der Waals parameters does not change hydrophilic solvation, since calculations using either water model lead to the same relative solvation free energy between ethane and methanol. The solvation free-energy differences between methane and ethane and between ethane and propane have also been calculated with both models, and results found with the two water models are similar. For the united-atom hydrocarbon model, however, the solvation free energy of methane changed from 2.1 kcal/mol with {TIP3P} to 1.8 kcal/mol with {TIP3PMOD.} (23 refs.)},

The computed changes in configurational entropy are comparable in magnitude to the changes in mean potential plus solvation energy, and they result primarily from changes in the average width of the energy wells upon binding.

The model was formulated and tested via Monte Carlo simulations for both the pure Liquids and dilute aqueous solutions of methane, ethane, propane, and butane and as such leaves no ambiguity in terms of its performance in either hydrophilic or hydrophobic environments. To evaluate accuracy, key comparisons with available experimental thermodynamic and structural data including heats of vaporization, molecular volumes, fluctuational properties, and radial distribution functions for the liquids as well as free energies of hydration were made and found to be in reasonable accord. Revisitation of the united-atom model showed that the all-atom force field performs with overall superiority (e.g., average deviations from experimentally measured free energies of hydration were reduced from 0.36 to 0.13 kcal/mol). Comparisons of the results with those from other force fields are also provided.},

To achieve this, a biased free energy function {(BFEF)} needs to be priori obtained. Although the quality of {BFEF} is essential for sampling efficiency, its generation is usually tedious and nontrivial. In this work, we present an energy space metadynamics algorithm to efficiently and robustly obtain {BFEFs.} Moreover, in order to deal with the associated diffusion sampling problem caused by the random walk in the total energy space, the idea in the original umbrella sampling method is generalized to be the random walk in the essential energy space, which only includes the energy terms determining the conformation of a region of interest. This essential energy space generalization allows the realization of efficient localized enhanced sampling and also offers the possibility of further sampling efficiency improvement when high frequency energy terms irrelevant to the target events are free of activation. The energy space metadynamics method and its generalization in the essential energy space for the molecular dynamics acceleration are demonstrated in the simulation of a pentanelike system, the blocked alanine dipeptide model, and the leucine model.},

	abstract = {The {\textbackslash}lambda-dynamics simulation method was used to study the binding of 10 five-member ring heterocycle derivatives to an artificial cavity created inside cytochrome C peroxidase by mutagenesis. Application of dynamics using a multiple topology approach resulted in trapping in local minima. To extend the method to these cases, a new restraining potential was devised and added to the extended Hamiltonian. Two approximations were introduced in order to estimate the binding free energy within small simulation times using this potential: (a) The entropy terms related to the restraining potential are assumed to cancel, due to the similarity of the ligands. (b) The restraining potential calculated from the coordinates of the environmental atoms during a -dynamics simulation is assumed to be equal to that of the average coordinates. Relatively short -dynamics simulations with this restraining potential successfully yielded reasonable estimates of the binding affinity of the ligands as compared with both experimental data and free energy perturbation calculations. Long time -dynamics simulations with a ten-ligand system revealed that better ligands tend to have small statistical errors, which is appropriate for screening out the plausible ligands from all candidates. Furthermore, short time -dynamics simulations with ten identical ligands demonstrated that sufficient precision was achieved for putative discovery of tight binding ligands or guests.},

	abstract = {Gas solubility in liquids is driven by favorable solute-solvent interactions while being opposed by the entropic cost of creating a molecular-sized cavity of suitable size. We have investigated these contributions to the solvation free energy of small hydrophobic solutes and studied the dependence of the entropy cost of solute insertion on solvent-solvent interactions in cosolvent/water mixtures by means of molecular dynamics simulations. The cosolvents acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide, and sodium chloride were studied. Acetone, which weakly interacts with water relative to hydrogen-bonding interactions in neat water, preferentially binds to hydrophobic solutes thereby raising their solubility. We find that this process is driven by a reduced entropic expense of opening up molecular-sized cavities close to the acetone methyl moieties. Sodium chloride and dimethyl sulfoxide are strongly hydrated, causing entropy to oppose hydrophobic solute insertion even stronger than it does in neat water. In sodium chloride/water the solute is preferentially âwettedâ causing it to be âsalted-outâ. Dimethyl sulfoxide methyl moieties bind to the hydrophobic solute. This process, occurring at the expense of entropy, is driven by a favorable solute-solvent energy and causes âsalting-inâ of the hydrophobic solute.},

A linear response model was developed for estimation of absolute binding free energies based on changes in electrostatic and van der Waals energies and solvent-accessible surface areas, which are accumulated during simulations of bound and unbound ligands.

In this study, computational methods are combined with experimental techniques. Molecular dynamics simulations, resonance Raman and {UV-VIS} spectroscopy, as well as coupling efficiency and substrate-binding experiments, have been performed. The computational findings, supported by the experimental results, enable structural rationalizations of the mutants. The substrates used in this study are known to be metabolized by human cytochrome P450 {2D6.} Interestingly, the major metabolites formed by the P450 {BM3} mutants differ from those formed by human cytochrome P450 {2D6.} The computational findings, supported by resonance Raman data, suggest a conformational change of one of the heme propionate groups. The modeling results furthermore suggest that this conformational change allows for an interaction between the negatively charged carboxylate of the heme substituent and the positively charged nitrogen of the substrates. This allows for an orientation of the substrates favorable for formation of the major metabolite by P450 {BM3.} Proteins 2008. {\textbackslash}copyright 2007 {Wiley-Liss,} Inc.},

We present an optimization approach with the example of Hamiltonian {REMD} using soft-core interactions on two model systems, {GTP} and {8-Br-GTP.} The optimization process using {REMD} mimicking is very fast. Optimization of {Hamiltonian-REMD} settings of {GTP} in explicit water took us less than one week. In our study we focus not only on finding the optimal distances between neighboring replicas, but also on finding the proper placement of the highest level of softness. In addition we suggest different {REMD} simulation settings at this softness level. We allow several replicas to be simulated at the same Hamiltonian simultaneously and reduce the frequency of switching attempts between them. This approach allows for more efficient conversions from one stable conformation to the other.},

The thermodynamic, structural and dynamic properties of the various models were investigated in detail. In particular, the potential energies, diffusion coefficients and rotational correlation times obtained for each model are compared with experiment. It is found that the theory of rotational Brownian motion fails in describing the rotational diffusion of chloroform. The force field of Dietz and Heinzinger was found to give good overall agreement with experiment. An extended investigation of this chloroform model has been performed. Values are reported for the isothermal compressibility, the thermal expansion coefficient and the constant volume heat capacity. The values agree well with experiment. The static and frequency dependent dielectric permittivity were computed from a 1.2 ns simulation conducted under reaction field boundary conditions. Considering the fact that the model is rigid with fixed partial charges, the static dielectric constant and Debye relaxation time compare well with experiment. From the same simulation the shear viscosity was computed using the off-diagonal elements of the pressure tensor, both via an Einstein type relation and via a {Green-Kubo} equation. The calculated viscosities show good agreement with experimental values. The excess Helmholtz energy is calculated using the thermodynamic integration technique and simulations of 50 and 80 ps. The value obtained for the excess Helmholtz energy matches the theoretical value within a few per cent.},

Some comparisons are also presented for {CHARMM} 22. The tests of conformational energies consisted of two sets of comparisons to experiment and one more extensive set of comparisons to relatively high-quality nb initio data. As in the derivation of {MMFF94,} scaled {HF/6-31G*} energies and geometries were used to assess the reasonableness of the calculated intermolecular interaction energies and geometries. The comparisons for intermolecular interactions arrear to be the first broadly based comparisons to appear in the chemical literature. Taken together, the comparisons reveal that most of the force fields make sizable errors and frequently produce qualitatively incorrect results for both conformational and intermolecular-interaction energies. For example, three of the force fields produce individual errors in conformational energy of more than 10 kcal/mol, and four rate thiophene as a stronger hydrogen-bond acceptor than ammonia. Only {MMFF94} and {MMFF94s} perform consistently well. Some {MMFF} deficiencies are apparent, however, particularly for conformational energies of halocyclohexanes. These deficiencies, and others recently found for condensed-phase simulations, will need to be addressed in any future reparameterization of {MMFF.} The quantum-chemical data used in this work have been placed on the Computational Chemistry List web site. {(C)} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.

Application to a training set of 594 compounds led to a correlation equation with a standard deviation, {SD,} of 0.56 log units. For a test set of 65 compounds, the {SD} was 0.50 log units, and for a combined correlation equation for 659 compounds, the {SD} was 0.56 log units. The correlation equations enable the factors that influence aqueous solubility to be revealed. The hydrogen-bond propensity of a compound always leads to an increase in solubility, even though the Sigma {alpha(2)(H)} X Sigma {beta(2)(H)} term opposes solubility due to interactions in the liquid or solid. Increase in solute dipolarity/polarizability increases solubility, whereas an increase in solute excess molar refraction, and especially, volume decrease solubility.

The experimental error in the free enthalpy of hydration, which is dominated by the inaccuracy of the Vapor pressure of solid urea, is larger than the simulation error. This limited accuracy does not allow a check of the nonideality of the solution. Free enthalpies have been obtained by thermodynamic integration. The importance of a correct use of the combinatorial factor in the partition function when interpreting simulation results obtained by thermodynamic integration is discussed.

	abstract = {We present a new approach to calculating conformational equilibria in complex molecules, multiple-copy locally enhanced sampling {(LES),} and apply this approach to the well-known alpha â{\textgreater} beta anomeric equilibrium in glucose. Although a variant of this method has been previously applied to protein stability mutations, it is particularly suited to analyze conformational equilibria in molecules such as glucose, with its many {OH} groups. This methodology allows us to more rapidly calculate complex equilibria both in vacuo and in solution. We have employed a âgenericâ force field using 1,1-dimethoxymethane and 1,1-dihydroxymethane as models to derive the torsional parameters associated with {O-C-O-C} and {O-C-O-H} fragments. Within this model, we can definitively establish the magnitude of intramolecular and solvation contributions to the alpha â{\textgreater} beta equilibrium. Specifically, we find that in vacuo glucose prefers to be in the alpha configuration by similar to 0.5-1.0 kcal/mol (predominantly because of the gauche tendency of the {O-C-O-C} linkage), and it is the solvation free energy which drives the equilibrium to the beta form {(Delta} G in solution = -0.2 kcal/mol calculated, -0.3 kcal/mol experimental). Using the {LES} approach, which reduces barriers to conformational transitions, we obtain free energies converged (compared to longer calculations) within 0.2 kcal/mol in 200 ps, both in vacuo and in water. Convergence for the single-copy method is considerably slower; variations in the calculated free energy of over 1 kcal/mol in vacuo and 0.5 kcal/mol in water are still observed in simulations of several nanoseconds in length. Thus, it appears that {LES} can be at least an order of magnitude faster to converge than single-copy methods.},

This makes it difficult to assess whether computational methods are truly predictive of this important quantity or merely good at explaining what has been seen. To explore this, a prospective test was performed of two different methods for estimating solvation free energies: an implicit solvent approach based on the {PoissonBoltzmann} equation and an explicit solvent approach using alchemical free energy calculations. For a set of 17 small molecules, root mean square errors from experiment were between 1.3 and 2.6 kcal/mol, with the explicit solvent free energy approach yielding somewhat greater accuracy but at greater computational expense. Insights from outliers and suggestions for future prospective challenges of this kind are presented.},

	title = {Generalized linear response method: Application to hydration free energy calculations},
	volume = {20},
	abstract = {A generalized linear response {(GLR)} method was developed and applied to hydration free energy calculations. According to this method, the atomic hydration can be described as a two-step process. In the first step a point particle is introduced into water, which, according to the scaled particle theory, creates a cavity with the size of a water molecule. The free energy change of this step for the simple point charge {(SPC)} water model can be calculated as {1.49k(B)T.} In the second step the introduced point particle is transformed into a solute atom. The free energy change of this step can be calculated by the linear response approximation, which is applied to van der Waals and electrostatic interactions, as {[V-H(a)](0.5)} Here {V-H(a)} is the solute-water interaction function, and [â¯](0.5) denotes the ensemble average at the midpoint of the thermodynamic path between the point particle state and the hydration state. The {GLR} method was tested by the calculation of hydration free energies of several neutral organic compounds. The results of the calculation were in close agreement with the experiment and were also comparable with those obtained by the conventional free energy simulation method; the computational cost was decreased by about one order of magnitude. The {GLR} approach is more general than the existing linear response methods for free energy calculations because it applies the linear response approximation to electrostatic and van der Waals interactions and does not incorporate any empirically determined parameters. {(C)} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble were carried out to calculate the vapor-liquid phase equilibria for methane, ethane, n-butane, n-pentane, and n-octane. The Williams, {OPLS-AA,} and {MMFF94} force fields were selected as representative all-atom models for this study because they were fitted using three different strategies {(Williams,} crystal structures and heats of sublimation; {OPLS-AA,} liquid densities and heats of vaporization; {MMFF94,} rare gas pair potentials and quantum mechanics) and employ potentials with the different functional forms to describe nonbonded van der Waals interactions {(Williams,} Buckingham exp-r(-6) {OPLS-AA,} {Lennard-Jones} 12-6; {MMFF94,} buffered 14-7). It is shown that seemingly small differences in the potential functions can account for very large changes in the fluid-phase behavior. The Williams and {OPLS-AA} force fields yield liquid densities, boiling temperatures, and critical points that are in acceptable, albeit not in quantitative agreement with experiments, whereas the fluid-phase behavior of the {MMFF94} model shows very large deviations.},

An overview of techniques to determine entropy differences is given, and the accuracy and convergence behavior of five methods based on thermodynamic integration and perturbation techniques was evaluated using liquid water as a test system. Reasonably accurate entropy differences are obtained through thermodynamic integration in which many copies of a solute are desolvated. When only one solute molecule is involved, only two methods seem to yield useful results, the calculation of solute-solvent entropy through thermodynamic integration, and the calculation of solvation entropy through the temperature derivative of the corresponding free-energy difference. One-step perturbation methods seem unsuitable to obtain entropy estimates. (41 refs.)},

In principle, {TS} should also be a good target for drugs used to fight infectious disease. In practice, {TS} is highly conserved across species, and it has proven to be difficult to develop inhibitors that are selective for microbial {TS} enzymes over the human enzyme. Using the structure of {TS} from Lactobacillus casei in complex with the nonsubstrate analogue phenolphthalein, inhibitors were designed to take advantage of features of the bacterial enzyme that differ from those of the human enzyme. Upon synthesis and testing, these inhibitors were found to be up to 40-fold selective for the bacterial enzyme over the human enzyme. The crystal structures of two of these inhibitors in complex with {TS} suggested the design of further compounds. Subsequent synthesis and testing showed that these second-round compounds inhibit the bacterial enzyme at sub-micromolar concentrations, while the human enzyme was not inhibited at detectable levels (selectivities of 100-1000-fold or greater). Although these inhibitors share chemical similarities, X-ray crystal structures reveal that the analogues bind to the enzyme in substantially different orientations. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggest that the individual inhibitors may adopt multiple configurations in their complexes with {TS.}},

	abstract = {Abstract: A new "super-extended cavity" tetraacetylcalix[4]pyrrole derivative was synthesized and characterized, and X-ray crystal structures of complexes bound to fluoride and acetonitrile were obtained. The binding behavior of this receptor was investigated by {NMR} titration, and the complex was found to exclusively bind fluoride ions in {DMSO-d6.} This unusual binding behavior was investigated by Monte Carlo free energy perturbation simulations and Poisson calculations, and the ion specificity was seen to result from the favorable electrostatic interactions that the fluoride gains by sitting lower in the phenolic cavity of the receptor. The effect of water present in the {DMSO} on the calculated free energies of binding was also investigated. Owing to the use of a saturated ion solution, the effect of contaminating water is small in this case; however, it has the potential to be very significant at lower ion concentrations. Finally, the adaptive umbrella {WHAM} protocol was investigated and optimized for use in binding free energy calculations, and its efficiency was compared to that of the free energy perturbation calculations; adaptive umbrella {WHAM} was found to be approximately two times more efficient. In addition, structural evidence demonstrates that the protocol explores a wider conformational range than free energy perturbation and should therefore be the method of choice. This paper represents the first complete application of this methodology to "alchemical" changes.},

Here, we examine the energetics of hydrating cavities formed at protein-ligand interfaces using molecular dynamics simulations. The free energies of hydrating two cavities in the active site of two liganded complexes of cytochrome P450cam were calculated by multiconfigurational thermodynamic integration. The complex of cytochrome P450cam with 2-phenyl-imidazole contains a crystallographically well defined water molecule mediating hydrogen bonds between the protein and the inhibitor. We calculate that this water molecule is stabilized by a binding free energy of -11.6 6.6 {kJ/mol.} The complex of cytochrome P450cam with its natural substrate, camphor, contains a cavity that is empty in the crystal structure although a water molecule in it could make a hydrogen bond to camphor. Here, solvation of this cavity is calculated to be unfavorable by 15.8 \${\textbackslash}pm\$ 5.0 {kJ/mol.} The molecular dynamics simulations can thus distinguish a hydrated interfacial cavity from an empty one. They also provide support for the notion that protein-ligand complexes can accommodate empty interfacial cavities and that such cavities are likely to be unless more than one bond can be made to water molecule in the cavity.},

	abstract = {Structure-based design has emerged as a new tool in medicinal chemistry. A prerequisite for this new approach is an understanding of the principles of molecular recognition in protein-ligand complexes. If the three-dimensional structure of a given protein is known, this information can be directly exploited for the retrieval and design of new ligands. Structure-based ligand design is an iterative approach. First of all, it requires the crystal structure or a model derived from the crystal structure of a closely related homolog of the target protein, preferentially complexed with a ligand. This complex unravels the binding mode and conformation of a ligand under investigation and indicates the essential aspects determining its binding affinity. It is then used to generate new ideas about ways of improving an existing ligand or of developing new alternative bonding skeletons. Computational methods supplemented by molecular graphics are applied to assist this step of hypothesis generation. The features of the protein binding pocket can be translated into queries used for virtual computer screening of large compound libraries or to design novel ligands de novo. These initial proposals must be confirmed experimentally. Subsequently they are optimized toward higher affinity and better selectivity. The latter aspect is of utmost importance in defining and controlling the pharmacological profile of a ligand. A prerequisite to tailoring selectivity by rational design is a detailed understanding of molecular parameters determining selectivity. Taking examples from current drug development programs {(HIV} proteinase, {t-RNA} transglycosylase, thymidylate synthase, thrombin and, related serine proteinases), we describe recent advances in lead discovery via computer screening, iterative design, and understanding of selectivity discrimination.},

The modified method is used to examine folding transitions of two peptides: deca-alanine and Met-enkephalin.

	abstract = {We consider ways to quantify the overlap of the parts of phase space important to two systems, labeled A and B. Of interest is how much of the A-important phase space lies in that important to B, and how much of B lies in A. Two measures are proposed. The first considers four total-energy distributions, formed from all combinations made by tabulating either the A-system or the B-system energy when sampling either the A or B system. Measures for A in B and B in A are given by two overlap integrals defined on pairs of these distributions. The second measure is based on information theory, and defines two relative entropies which are conveniently expressed in terms of the dissipated work for free-energy perturbation {(FEP)} calculations in the {A-{\textgreater}B} and {B-{\textgreater}A} directions, respectively. Phase-space overlap is an important consideration in the performance of free-energy calculations. To demonstrate this connection, we examine bias in {FEP} calculations applied to a system of independent particles in a harmonic potential. Systems are selected to represent a range of overlap situations, including extreme subset, subset, partial overlap, and nonoverlap. The magnitude and symmetry of the bias {(A-{\textgreater}B} vs. {B-{\textgreater}A)} are shown to correlate well with the overlap, and consequently with the overlap measures. The relative entropies are used to scale the amount of sampling to obtain a universal bias curve. This result leads to develop a simple heuristic that can be applied to determine whether a work-based free-energy measurement is free of bias. The heuristic is based in part on the measured free energy, but we argue that it is fail-safe inasmuch as any bias in the measurement will not promote a false indication of accuracy.},

Some energy models used in computer-aided ligand design neglect this entropic penalty, whereas others account for it based on an expected drop in the number of accessible rotamers upon binding. However, the validity of the physical assumptions underlying the various approaches is largely unexamined. The present study addresses this issue by using Mining Minima calculations to analyze the association of amprenavir with {HIV} protease. The computed loss in ligand configurational entropy is large, contributing [ ]25 kcal/mol (4.184 {kJ/kcal)} to {DeltaGdegrees.} Most of this loss results from narrower energy wells in the bound state, rather than a drop in the number of accessible rotamers. Coupling among rotation/translation and internal degrees of freedom complicates the decomposition of the entropy change into additive terms. The results highlight the potential to gain affinity by designing conformationally restricted ligands and have implications for the formulation of energy models for ligand scoring. 10.1073/pnas.0610494104},

	abstract = {The ligand-protein docking algorithm based on the mining minima method has been substantially enhanced. First, the basic algorithm is accelerated by: (1) adaptively determining the extent of each energy well to help avoid previously discovered energy minima; (2) biasing the search away from ligand positions at the surface of the receptor to prevent the ligand from staying at the surface when large sampling regions are used; (3) quickly testing multiple different ligand positions and orientations for each ligand conformation; and (4) tuning the source code to increase computational efficiency. These changes markedly shorten the time needed to discover an accurate result, especially when large sampling regions are used. The algorithm now also allows user-selected receptor sidechains to be treated as mobile during the docking procedure. The energies associated with the mobile side chains are computed as if they belonged to the ligand, except that atoms at the boundary between side chains and the rigid backbone are treated specially. This new capability is tested for several well-known ligand/protein systems, and preliminary application to an enzyme whose substrate is unknown-the recently solved hypothetical protein {YecO} {(HI0319)} from Haemophilus influenzae-indicates that side-chains relaxations allow candidate substrates of various sizes to be accommodated.

	doi = {10.1006/jmbi.2000.4285},
	abstract = {Specific amino acid binding by {aminoacyl-tRNA} synthetases {(aaRS)} is necessary for correct translation of the genetic code. Engineering a modified specificity into {aminoacyl-tRNA} synthetases has been proposed as a means to incorporate artificial amino acid residues into proteins in vivo. In a previous paper, the binding to {aspartyl-tRNA} synthetase of the substrate Asp and the analogue Asn were compared by molecular dynamics free energy simulations. Molecular dynamics combined with {Poisson-Boltzmann} free energy calculations represent a less expensive approach, suitable for examining multiple active site mutations in an engineering effort. Here, {Poisson-Boltzmann} free energy calculations for {aspartyl-tRNA} synthetase are first validated by their ability to reproduce selected molecular dynamics binding free energy differences, then used to examine the possibility of Asn binding to native and mutant {aspartyl-tRNA} synthetase. A component analysis of the {Poisson-Boltzmann} free energies is employed to identify specific interactions that determine the binding affinities. The combined use of molecular dynamics free energy simulations to study one binding process thoroughly, followed by molecular dynamics and {Poisson-Boltzmann} free energy calculations to study a series of related ligands or mutations is proposed as a paradigm for protein or ligand design. The binding of Asn in an alternate, "head-to-tail" orientation observed in the homologous asparagine synthetase is analyzed, and found to be more stable than the {"Asp-like"} orientation studied earlier. The new orientation is probably unsuitable for catalysis. A conserved active site lysine {(Lys198} in Escherichia coli) that recognizes the Asp side-chain is changed to a leucine residue, found at the corresponding position in {asparaginyl-tRNA} synthetase. It is interesting that the binding of Asp is calculated to increase slightly (rather than to decrease), while that of Asn is calculated, as expected, to increase strongly, to the same level as Asp binding. Insight into the origin of these changes is provided by the component analyses. The double mutation {(K198L,D233E)} has a similar effect, while the triple mutation {(K198L,Q199E,D233E)} reduces Asp binding strongly. No binding measurements are available, but the three mutants are known to have no ability to adenylate Asn, despite the {"Asp-like"} binding affinities calculated here. In molecular dynamics simulations of all three mutants, the Asn ligand backbone shifts by 1-2 A compared to the experimental {Asp:AspRS} complex, and significant side-chain rearrangements occur around the pocket. These could reduce the {ATP} binding constant and/or the adenylation reaction rate, explaining the lack of catalytic activity in these complexes. Finally, Asn binding to {AspRS} with neutral K198 or charged H449 is considered, and shown to be less favorable than with the charged K198 and neutral H449 used in the analysis.},

	abstract = {The free energy difference between two states of a molecular system separated by an energy barrier can generally be computed using the technique of umbrella sampling along a chosen reaction coordinate or pathway. The effect of a particular choice of pathway upon the obtained free energy difference is investigated by molecular dynamics simulation of a model system consisting of a glycine dipeptide in aqueous solution. Two different reaction coordinates connecting the so-called C-5 and C-7 conformations, one involving intramolecular hydrogen bonds and the other involving the peptide phi,psi angles, are considered. The Gibbs free energy differences Delta {G(C-5} - C-7) are small in both cases, 1.5 +/- 1 {kJ} mol(-1) and 2.2 +/- 1 {kJ} mol(-1), respectively. The two different reaction coordinates yield free energy differences that are identical to within their statistical error. It is found that the exchange of solute-solute, solute-water, and water-water hydrogen bonds involves free energy changes of less than {k(B)T,} which points at the existence of a multitude of low free energy pathways connecting the C-5 and C-7 dipeptide conformations.},

A new Hamiltonian-replica exchange molecular dynamics {(H-RexMD)} method has been designed that effectively combines information extracted from an {ENM} analysis with atomic-resolution {MD} simulations. The {ENM} analysis is used to construct a distance-dependent penalty (flooding or biasing) potential that can drive the structure away from its current conformation in directions compatible with the {ENM} model. Various levels of the penalty or biasing potential are added to the force field description of the {MD} simulation along the replica coordinate. One replica runs at the original force field. By focusing the penalty potential on the relevant soft degrees of freedom the method avoids the rapid increase of the replica number with increasing system size to cover a desired temperature range in conventional (temperature) {RexMD} simulations. The application to domain motions in lysozyme of bacteriophage T4 and to peptide folding indicates significantly improved conformational sampling compared to conventional {MD} simulations.},

@article{givon_extracting_????,
	title = {Extracting macroscopic dynamics: Model problems and algorithms},
	abstract = {In many applications, the primary objective of numerical simulation of time-evolving systems is the prediction of macroscopic, or coarse-grained, quantities. A representative example is the prediction of biomolecular conformations from molecular dynamics. In recent years a number of new algorithmic approaches have been introduced to extract effective, lower-dimensional, models for the macroscopic dynamics; the starting point is the full, detailed, evolution equations. In many cases the effective low-dimensional dynamics may be stochastic, even when the original starting point is deterministic. This review surveys a number of these new approaches to the problem of extracting effective dynamics, highlighting similarities and differences between them. The importance of model problems for the evaluation of these new approaches is stressed, and a number of model problems are described. When the macroscopic dynamics is stochastic, these model problems are either obtained through a clear separation of time-scales, leading to a stochastic effect of the fast dynamics on the slow dynamics, or by considering high dimensional ordinary differential equations which, when projected onto a low dimensional subspace, exhibit stochastic behaviour through the presence of a broad frequency spectrum. Models whose stochastic microscopic behaviour leads to deterministic macroscopic dynamics are also introduced. The algorithms we overview include {SVD-based} methods for nonlinear problems, model reduction for linear control systems, optimal prediction techniques, asymptotics-based mode elimination, coarse timestepping methods and transfer-operator based methodologies.},

	abstract = {For classical systems with anharmonic forces, Newton's equations for particle trajectories are nonlinear, while Liouville's equation for the evolution of functions of position and momentum is linear and is solved by constructing a basis of functions in which the Liouvillian is a tridiagonal matrix, which is then diagonalized. For systems that are chaotic in the sense that neighboring trajectories diverge exponentially, the initial conditions determine the solution to Liouville's equation for short times; but for long times, the solutions decay exponentially at rates independent of the initial conditions. These are the relaxation rates of irreversible processes, and they arise in these calculations as the imaginary parts of the frequencies where there are singularities in the analytic continuations of solutions to Liouville's equation. These rates are calculated for two examples: the inverted oscillator, which can be solved both analytically and numerically, and a charged particle in a periodic magnetic field, which can only be solved numerically. In these systems, dissipation arises from traveling-wave solutions to Liouville's equation that couple low and high wave-number modes allowing energy to flow from disturbances that are coherent over large scales to disturbances on ever smaller scales finally becoming incoherent over microscopic scales. These results suggest that dissipation in large scale motion of the system is a consequence of chaos in the small scale motion. { S1063-651X 99 07405-X }},

	abstract = {We describe here a general Amber force field {(GAFF)} for organic molecules. {GAFF} is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of {GAFF} in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to {GAFF} minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 {AA,} which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 {AA)} and better than those of {MMFF} 94 and {CHARMm} (0.47 and 0.44 {AA,} respectively). In test {II,} gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to {MP2/6-31G*} results. The {RMS} of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 {AA} and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from {Parm99/RESP} (0.16 {AA} and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test {III} looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The {RMS} error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. {GAFF} can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching.

	abstract = {Abstract: Implicit solvent models are increasingly popular for estimating aqueous solvation (hydration) free energies in molecular simulations and other applications. In many cases, parameters for these models are derived to reproduce experimental values for small molecule hydration free energies. Often, these hydration free energies are computed for a single solute conformation, neglecting solute conformational changes upon solvation. Here, we incorporate these effects using alchemical free energy methods. We find significant errors when hydration free energies are estimated using only a single solute conformation, even for relatively small, simple, rigid solutes. For example, we find conformational entropy {(TS)} changes of up to 2.3 kcal/mol upon hydration. Interestingly, these changes in conformational entropy correlate poorly {(R2} = 0.03) with the number of rotatable bonds. The present study illustrates that implicit solvent modeling can be improved by eliminating the approximation that solutes are rigid.},

	abstract = {In this work we demonstrate the use of a rigorous formalism for the extraction of state-to-state transition functions as a way to study the kinetics of protein folding in the context of a Markov chain. The approach is illustrated by its application to two different systems: a blocked alanine dipeptide in a vacuum and the C-terminal beta-hairpin motif from protein G in water. The first system displays some of the desired features of the approach, whereas the second illustrates some of the challenges that must be overcome to apply the method to more complex biomolecular systems. For both example systems, Boltzmann weighted conformations produced by a replica exchange Monte Carlo procedure were used as starting states for kinetic trajectories. The alanine dipeptide displays Markovian behavior in a state space defined with respect to phi-psi torsion angles. In contrast, Markovian behavior was not observed for the beta-hairpin in a state space where all possible native hydrogen bonding patterns were resolved. This may be due to our choice of state definitions or sampling limitations. Furthermore, the use of different criteria for hydrogen bonding results in the apparent observation of different mechanisms from the same underlying data: one set of criteria indicate a zipping type of process, but another indicates more of a collapse followed by almost simultaneous formation of a large number of contacts. Analysis of long-lived states observed during the simulations of the beta-hairpin suggests that important aspects of the folding process that are not captured by order parameters in common use include the formation of non-native hydrogen bonds and the degree and nature of salt bridge formation.},

The second method relies on thermodynamic integration of the average force and is called the adaptive biasing force method {[Darve} and Pohorille, J. Chem. Phys. 115, 9169 (2001)]. Both methods are designed such that the system evolves along the chosen coordinate(s) without experiencing free energy barriers and they require calculating the instantaneous, unconstrained force acting on this coordinate using the formula derived by Darve and Pohorille. Efficiencies are analyzed by comparing analytical estimates of statistical errors and by considering two numerical examples-internal rotation of hydrated 1,2-dichloroethane and transfer of fluoromethane across a water-hexane interface. The efficiencies of both methods are approximately equal in the first but not in the second case. During transfer of fluoromethane the system is easily driven away from equilibrium and, therefore, the performance of the method based on Jarzynski's identity is poor.},

For a diatomic with point charges (dipole moment=2.4 D) in a box of water, the free energy corresponding to charge rearrangements of the order of +/-0.25e could be predicted accurately after 750 ps of simulation and inclusion of the third derivative. Predictions were best for small perturbations. After 1000 ps of simulation, the first, second, third, and probably the fourth derivatives had converged, while the fifth was still oscillating.

We develop a quantitative model of the calculation in terms of the so-called f and g distributions that characterize the energies sampled in a {FEP} calculation. The model is then re-expressed in terms of the entropy difference between the systems of interest, and the variance of the g distribution. We apply the model to analyze the optimization of multistage insertion free energy calculations, and reach a quantitative criterion for minimizing the overall variance. The analysis indicates that the appropriate heuristic for optimizing the choice of intermediates is to select them to equalize the entropy differences among all stages of the overall {FEP} calculation. A more accurate criterion is specified, but in practice it differs little from this simpler one. We illustrate our conclusions by conducting two-stage {FEP} calculations using Monte Carlo simulations on {Lennard-Jones} {(LJ)} systems at several temperatures and two densities. The {LJ} systems differ in the presence of a single {LJ} particle, and the intermediate is defined to have a single hard sphere of diameter that can be used to optimize the two-stage {FEP} calculation. The model provides an excellent description of the precision of the {FEP} calculations. {(C)} 1999 American Institute of Physics. {[S0021-9606(99)51534-1].}},

The catalytic domain F1 of the {F1Fo} complex, {F1-ATPase,} has the ability to hydrolyze {ATP.} A fundamental problem in the development of a detailed mechanism for this enzyme is that it has not been possible to determine experimentally the relation between the ligand binding affinities measured in solution and the different conformations of the catalytic [beta] subunits {([beta]TP,} {[beta]DP,} {[beta]E)} observed in the crystal structures of the mitochondrial enzyme, {MF1.} Using free energy difference simulations for the hydrolysis reaction {ATP} {H2O} [right-arrow] {ADP} Pi in the {[beta]TP} and {[beta]DP} sites and unisite hydrolysis data, we are able to identify {[beta]TP} as the "tight" {(KD} = 10[-]12 M, {MF1)} binding site for {ATP} and {[beta]DP} as the "loose" site. An energy decomposition analysis demonstrates how certain residues, some of which have been shown to be important in catalysis, modulate the free energy of the hydrolysis reaction in the {[beta]TP} and {[beta]DP} sites, even though their structures are very similar. Combined with the recently published simulations of the rotation cycle of {F1-ATPase,} the present results make possible a consistent description of the binding change mechanism of {F1-ATPase} at an atomic level of detail. 10.1073/pnas.0337432100},

We have developed a general method for optimizing binding specificity in ligand-receptor complexes based on the theory of electrostatic charge optimization. This methodology can be used to tune the binding of a ligand to a panel of potential targets and decoys, along the continuum from narrow binding to only one partner to broad binding to the entire panel. Using {HIV-1} protease as a model system, we probe specificity in three distinct ways. First, we probe interactions that could make the promiscuous protease inhibitor pepstatin more selective toward {HIV-1} protease. Next, we study clinically approved {HIV-1} protease inhibitors and probe ways to broaden the binding profiles toward both wild-type {HIV-1} protease and drug-resistant mutants. Finally, we study a conformational ensemble of wild-type {HIV-1} protease to 'design in' broad specificity to known drugs before resistance mutations arise. The results from this conformational ensemble were similar to those from the drug-resistant ensemble, suggesting the use of a conformational wild-type ensemble as a tool to develop escape-mutant-resistant inhibitors.},

	abstract = {A simultaneous improvement of the diffusion and dielectric properties of the simple point charge {(SPC)} model for liquid water appears to be very difficult with conventional reparametrization of the commonly used {Lennard-Jones} and Coulomb interaction functions and without including a self-energy correction in the effective pair-potential as is done in the {SPC/E} model. Here, a different approach to circumvent this problem is presented. A short-range interaction term, which corrects the oxygen-oxygen energy at small distances by small amounts of energy, was introduced in the nonbonded interaction function. This additional force-field term allows to derive new parameter sets for {SPC-like} water models that yield better agreement with experimental data on liquid water. Based on previous investigations of the force-field parameter dependence of the water properties of {SPC-like} models, the necessary parameter changes to obtain a lower diffusion coefficient and a larger dielectric permittivity were specified and accordingly six new models were developed. They all represent an improvement over {SPC} in terms of structural and diffusional properties, four of them show better dielectric properties also. One model, {SPC/S,} has been characterized in more detail, and represents most properties of liquid water better than {SPC} while avoiding the larger discrepancies with experimental values regarding density, thermal compressibility, energy, and free energy of the {SPC/E} model. We conclude that the use of a simple, short-ranged additional oxygen-oxygen interaction term makes a simultaneous improvement of the diffusion coefficient and the dielectric properties of water feasible.

	volume = {13},
	abstract = {Errors in free energies for molecular replacement and for conformation change of a small model peptide have been determined empirically by repeated simulations from different starting points. All calculations have been done using thermodynamic integration, in which the system's potential energy is coupled to a parameter-lambda that is increased or decreased by a small amount at each step of the simulation. The effects of several factors that may alter the precision are evaluated. These factors include: the length of the simulation, the dependence of the potential energy on lambda, the use of conformational restraints, and their magnitude and form. The methods used for restraint and conformational forcing are described in detail. The free energy change, calculated as the mean from several successive simulations with alternately increasing and decreasing-lambda, is found to be independent of the length of the simulations. As expected, longer simulations produce more precise results. The variation of the calculated free energies is found to consist of two parts, a random error and a systematic hysteresis, i.e., a dependence on the direction in which lambda-changes. The hysteresis varies as the inverse of the length of the simulation and the random error as the inverse square root. The advantage of the use of a different (nonlinear) dependence of the attractive and repulsive parts of the nonbonded potential energy on the coupling parameter when 'creating' particles in solution is found to be very large. This nonlinear coupling was found to be superior to the use of linear coupling and a nonlinear change of the coupling parameter with the simulation time. The hysteresis in conformational free energy calculations is found to increase markedly if too weak a forcing restraint is chosen. It is shown how to deconvolute the contribution of a torsional restraint from the dependence of the free energy on a torsion angle.},

Here we present how parallel tempering {(PT)} Monte Carlo and weighted histogram analysis method {(WHAM)} can be used to improve the efficiency of free energy calculations. For both methods, which can be used separately or together, simulations at more than one temperature are performed. The same additional temperatures are often used to determine entropy changes. The results, for the aqueous solvation of n-butane and methane, show noticeable improvement in the precision of the free energy and entropy changes. The {PT} and {WHAM} methods can give similar error bars as conventional molecular dynamics in half the simulation time. The methods offer an efficient procedure for calculating free energy, entropy, and enthalpy changes in which free energy calculations are performed in parallel for a small number of closely spaced temperatures (for example, as here, at three temperatures: 298 K and 298 ( 15 K), and {WHAM} is used to enhance the data at each temperature.},

	abstract = {Chemistry Department, Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, Hauz Khas, New Delhi 11 00 16, India Smart polymeric materials respond with a considerable change in their properties to small changes in their environment. Environmental stimuli include temperature, {pH,} chemicals, and light. {âSmartâ} stimuli-sensitive materials can be either synthetic or natural. This review discusses the application of smart materials as tools to solve biological problems such as bioseparation, drug delivery, biosensor design, tissue engineering, protein folding, and microfluidics. The goal for these endeavors is to mimic the âsmartnessâ of biological systems and ultimately moderate complex systems such as immune responses at desired levels. The versatility and untapped potential of smart polymeric materials makes them one of the most exciting interfaces of chemistry and biology. Over the last decade, smart polymeric materials have been used in biochemical sciences in many ways. Since the term âsmart polymeric materialsâ encompasses a wide spectrum of different compounds with unique potential for biological applications, and since interest in generating and manipulating these compounds is growing, we felt that it would be useful to assemble an overview of the field to aid in catalyzing cross-fertilization of ideas. The present review aims to bring together the exciting design of these materials and the ever-expanding range of their uses by focusing on hydrogels as a key example of this technology. Smart or stimuli-responsive polymers respond to small changes in their environment with dramatic changes in their physical properties {(Table} 1). Smart polymers are either reversibly soluble-insoluble {(SIS)} in aqueous media or crosslinked in the form of hydrogels. Specifically, hydrogels are networks of hydrophilic polymers that expand or swell by taking up âfrom 10\%â20\% up to thousands of times their dry weight in waterâ [1]. Physical hydrogels are held together with noncovalent forces, whereas chemical hydrogels are obtained by chemical crosslinking; both kinds of gels are structurally inhomogeneous. Physical hydrogels have hydrophilic and hydrophobic domains, whereas chemical hydrogels have âclustersâ or regions of high crosslinking density (low swelling structure) present in an otherwise low crosslinking density (high swelling structure) polymeric network. During water uptake, hydration occurs first at hydrophilic moieties (âprimary bound waterâ), then at hydrophobic sites (âsecondary bound waterâ) and at spaces between the chains and pores (âfree or bulk waterâ) [1]. {SIS} polymers can be synthetic {[poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)} and methylmethacrylates polymers] {(Figure} 1) or natural (alginate, chitosan, and Îº-carrageenan [2 and 3]), or a combination of both [collagen-acrylate and poly(polyethylene glycol-co-peptides)] [1]. Both {SIS} polymers and hydrogels have been shown to respond to a variety of stimuli such as changes in {pH,} temperature, ionic strength, light, electricity, and magnetic field {(Table} 1) [4]. The swelling (uptake of additional water) and solubility responses for hydrogels and {SIS} polymers, respectively, have a common mechanism. Application of stimulus changes the nanostructure and increases or decreases the overall hydrophilicity. For example, a {pH-responsive} polymer (or hydrogel) could be subjected to ionization of a free carboxyl group (like in methacrylates), and a thermosensitive polymer, like {poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)} {[poly(NIPAAm)],} would deswell as the temperature is raised beyond lower critical solution temperature {(LCST).} The change in network volume (the smartness readout) arises because there is a balance of hydrophilic {(-CONH-)} and hydrophobic {[-CH(CH3)2-]} moieties, therefore, below {LCST;} the gel is swollen, hydrated, and hydrophilic. However, above {LCST} it is collapsed, dehydrated, and hydrophobic. The thermosensitive gel {poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)} {(NIPAAm)} is one of the most commonly studied smart systems, and various strategies for synthesizing the hydrogel and its derivatives have been described. Efforts have been directed toward altering the swelling/shrinking behavior and preparing copolymers that also respond to other stimuli. Critical insight into the deswelling mechanism was gained by the Hoffman group's seminal work on {PNIPAAm} [5]. Researchers showed that gel collapse at {LCST} {(38.5Â°C)} is entropy driven since bound water molecules are freed. Collapse is accompanied by âskinâ formation around the trapped pockets of water; therefore, deswelling kinetics are biphasic with faster expulsion of water through weakly densified gel portions followed by slower release of water through the more densified collapsed gel layer on the surface. The comonomers (along with {NIPAAm)} which have been assessed are acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, 2-methyl-2-acrylamidopropane sulfonic acid, trimethyl-acrylamidopropyl ammonium 3-methyl-1-vinylimidazolium iodide, sodium acrylate, sodium methacrylate, and 1-(3-sulphopropyl)-2-vinyl-pyridinium betaine [6, 7 and 8]. The use of methacrylic acid, along with {NIPAAm,} not only changes {LCST} but also makes the hydrogels responsive to both temperature and {pH} [8]. Polymethacrylic acid chains do not expand readily before a critical charge density (due to ionized carboxyl groups) is reached. The copolymers of {NIPAAm} and methacrylic acid, in addition to hydrophobic and ionic binding, also involve hydrogen bonding between the amide and carboxyl groups of the two monomers [9]. Consequently, it was found that at any {pH} below {pKa} of the methacrylate moiety, the copolymers reached lower swelling ratios as compared to either of the homopolymers, since hydrogen bonding presumably acts as additional crosslinks that keep water out. Soluble copolymers of N-isopropylacrylamide and acrylic acid containing photodimerizable chromophores, like stilbene, styryl pyridinium, and acridizinium moieties, have been synthesized with a view to using light for inducing crosslinking [10]. Unfortunately, adequate reversibility of this photochemical switching could not be achieved in any of the cases. The most frequently used method of polymerizing {NIPAAm} with {N,Nâ²-methylene} bisacrylamide as a crosslinker via free radical crosslinking polymerization is exothermic [11]. The usual polymerization temperatures are close to {LCST.} Thus, any local or overall temperature increase above {LCST} results in pockets of phase separation and formation of spatially inhomogeneous gels. Real-time temperature and photon transmission measurements showed that polymerization even below {LCST} produced inhomogeneous network, whereas at temperatures higher than {LCST,} the gel system âundergoes a phase transition via a spinodal decomposition processâ [11]. Kim et al. [12] have grafted {PNIPAAm} onto the surface of {pH-responsive} alginate to obtain a macroporous hydrogel with faster swelling/deswelling rates. Much less work has been done with hydrogels, which respond to stimuli other than {pH,} temperature, and light. A hydrogel based upon ethylene-co-vinyl acetate, responsive to magnetic field, has been described [13]. Hydrogels based upon similar structures have also been described as responsive to ultrasonic radiation [13]. Of special interest are naturally occurring polysaccharides like chitosan, alginate, and Îº-carrageenan that behave as reversibly soluble-insoluble polymers by responding to {pH,} Ca2+, and K+, respectively [2 and 3]. Recently, a polymer sensitive to {pH} and temperature has been prepared by genetic engineering [14]. These are block copolymers containing repeating sequences from silk {(GAGAGS)} and elastin {(GVGVP),} where, in some cases, valine has been replaced by glutamic acid. By varying the extent of this change, the sensitivity to {pH,} temperature, and ionic strength could be controlled fairly precisely. Recombinant methods have also been used to design multidomain assemblies in which leucine zipper domains flank a central flexible polyelectrolyte [15]. {pH/temperature} stimuli trigger sol-gel transition. Extrapolation of this to create a seamless conjugate with specific biological activity is an exciting possibility. The cost of the bioseparation step is a critical factor in determining the overall production cost of a protein. Use of smart polymers has led to some simple and economical strategies in bioseparation. In affinity precipitation, the smart macroaffinity ligand (soluble form) is mixed with the crude broth containing the target protein [2]. Usually, the smart macroaffinity ligand is prepared by chemical coupling of a suitable affinity ligand to a smart polymer. Occasionally, it is possible to exploit the inherent and fortuitous affinity of the polymer for the affinity capture of the desired protein. Applying specific stimuli for the smart polymer precipitates the complex of the macroaffinity ligand-target protein. The complex of the macroaffinity ligand-target protein is dissociated, and the smart macroaffinity ligand is usually recycled. The technique is scalable and does not require any costly equipment [2]. In many cases, selectivity of the affinity interactions ensures that the purity obtained is at least of the level of single band in {SDS-PAGE} [3, 4 and 16]. The use of aqueous two-phase systems (such as {PEG-dextran)} for protein separation has been around for a long time. It has been shown that smart macroaffinity ligand-target proteins can be recovered from the {PEG} phase, and the two phases can be reused. This approach was successfully demonstrated by the purification of microbial xylanases, pullulanases, wheat germ Î±-amylase, and sweet potato Î²-amylase [17 and 18]. Another attractive extension of this approach has been to separate animal cells by crafting the smart macroaffinity ligands by coupling an antibody (against a cell surface protein) to a smart polymer [19]. Macroaffinity ligand-facilitated three-phase partitioning {(MLFTPP)} converts three-phase partitioning {(TPP)} [4] into a more selective and predictable technique for bioseparation of proteins using smart affinity ligands [20, 21 and 22]. Techniques like affinity precipitation, aqueous two-phase partitioning, and {MLFTPP} remain underexploited by biochemists, as their description is limited to journals devoted to biochemical engineering/biotechnology. By now, these techniques show sufficient promise to be adopted and routinely used by biochemists and molecular biologists. Over the years, immobilized enzymes have emerged as the preferred forms in which enzymes are used for various applications. Use of smart polymers for immobilization of enzymes allows reuse of the biocatalyst after homogeneous catalysis [23]. The separation (and reuse) of the bioconjugate can be simply done by precipitation. Thus, the benefits of homogeneous catalysis can be combined with the convenience of recovery/reuse of heterogeneous catalysts. The advantage of homogeneous biocatalysis (by using a soluble form of the smart polymer-enzyme bioconjugate) may be illustrated by the example of {chitosan-Î±-L-rhamnopyranosidase} [24]. The immobilized enzyme retained the kinetic parameters {(Michaelis} constant, Km; and maximal velocity, Vmax) of the free enzyme. The biocatalyst was used successfully for increasing the aroma of a model wine solution [24]. In nonaqueous media, immobilization has been widely used for stabilization of the enzyme against inactivation due to the media [25]. A photoresponsive copolymer linked to subtilisin was successfully used for a transesterification reaction in toluene [26]. Unfortunately, the rate of transesterification was no better than enzyme powders, showing that the bioconjugation failed to stabilize the enzyme. Hydrogels have also been used for immobilizing enzymes. The pioneering work of Hoffman with Î²-galactosidase deserves special mention [27]. A more recent example is encapsulation of Î±-chymotrypsin in a photosensitive hydrogel [28]. When exposed to light of different wavelengths, the hydrogel changes its permeability to the amide substrate. This âonâ and âoffâ cycle could be carried out repeatedly in a reversible fashion. Most extensive efforts in this area have been made for developing insulin release systems in response to high glucose levels [29]. In an early approach, entrapped insulin was released from copolymers of allylglucose crosslinked with Concanavalin A. In many later designs, glucose oxidase has been used to generate H+ (in response to the presence of glucose) and hence exploit {pH-sensitive} hydrogels. One common worry in all such cases is the slow response time. Thus, use of superporous hydrogels with fast swelling-deswelling kinetics ({\textless}1 min) is a step in the right direction [30]. The well-known interaction between boronic acid and sugars has been used to design glucose-responsive insulin-release systems [29]. To bring the {pH} of insulin release closer to the physiological conditions, it was necessary to coordinate the boron atom with an inbuilt amino group. It has also been possible to ensure that this system has a dosage capacity required for clinical use and is rechargeable once insulin is exhausted. Use of the presence of glucose to increase the {LCST} of the thermoresponsive hydrogels of acrylamidophenylboronic acid and {NIPAAm} has also been evaluated. This system did exhibit the useful characteristic of requiring a threshold glucose concentration to release insulin [29]. In a slightly different approach, {pH-sensitive} {poly(NIPAAm/MAA)} nanoparticles were embedded along with glucose oxidase and catalase in an ethylcellulose-based membrane [31]. The rate of insulin release was modulated by glucose concentration due to volume changes in the embedded nanoparticles. The response lag time was about 5â15 min as reduction of polymer dimension to nanometer led to faster response. Unfortunately, the permeability cycles (to test reusability) were not reproducible since the design did not âallow sufficient time for removing the diffusants from the membraneâ [31]. Polyoxamer-407, a nontoxic copolymer consisting of polyethylene and polyoxypropylene, blocks changes reversibly from a low viscosity solution (at {4Â°C)} to a semisolid gel at body temperature [32]. In vivo results with intraperitonial administration of {melanotar-I} (an analog of {Î±-MSH)} along with polyoxamer showed that the polymer did prolong its half-life in plasma, presumably due to its slow release from the gel formed in the intraperitoneal cavity. A disadvantage of polyoxamers is that they are nonbiodegradable and are known to enhance plasma cholesterol and triacylglycerol after intraperitoneal injection in rats [33]. Jeong et al. [34] have described the synthesis of a thermoresponsive hydrogel consisting of blocks of poly(ethylene oxide) and {poly(L-lactic} acid). The polymer (at {45Â°C),} upon subcutaneous injection and subsequent rapid cooling to body temperature, undergoes a sol-gel transition. The entrapped drug was released at first by diffusion and then at a faster rate as degradation mechanisms started operating. Unlike {NIPAAm-based} polymers or polyoxamers, these nontoxic polymers are biodegradable and form biocompatible and pharmacologically inactive products. A {pH-responsive} hydrogel composed of polymethacrylic acid grafted with polyethylene glycol has been evaluated in vitro for calcitonin delivery [35]. This polypeptide is a therapeutic agent for bone diseases like Paget's disease, hypercalcemia, and osteoporesis. As the {pH} increased during the passage from the stomach to upper small intestine, the ionized pendant carboxyl groups caused electrostatic repulsion, the network swelled, and the hormone was released. The release behavior showed that movement of polymer chains was a key factor that controlled the solute transport. Qiu and Park [36] have also reviewed various hydrogels responsive to various stimuli. An example worth quoting from their review uses the concept of release of antibiotics at the site and time of infection. The antibiotic, Gentamycin, was attached to the polyvinyl alcohol backbone through peptide linkers. Infected wounds produced a higher concentration of thrombin which snapped the peptide linkers and accelerated the release of the antibiotic. An example that mimics the chemical and biological design of a natural secretory granule is the anionic microgel, composed of a 1:4 mole ratio of methylene-bis-acrylamide and methacrylic acid and loaded with the cationic anticancer drug, doxorubicin [37]. These microgels showed {\textgreater}300\% volume change when their {pH} was changed from 3.2 to 7.0 (diameter 6.5 Î¼m) due to deprotonation of carboxyl groups. The coating of condensed microgel with a lipid membrane moved the design closer to a natural secretory granule but prevented {pH-responsive} volume expansion. A major challenge in the delivery of biotherapeutics is in developing strategies for overcoming lysosomal degradation of internalized drug molecules. Poly(propylacrylic acid), a {pH-responsive} polymer, disrupts cell membranes at low {pH} values prevailing in endosomes [38]. It was shown that a ternary complex of biotinylated {anti-CD3} antibody, streptavidin, and biotinylated polymer with a fluorescent label resulted in enhanced translocation to the cytoplasm of Jurkat cells. Again, as better designs evolve, inspiration comes from biology [39]. A âbioinspired {pH-responsive} polymerâ is modified polyethylene glycol {(E3),} which can deliver the linked peptide to lysosome {(Figure} 2). The graft on {PEG} is a membrane-disruptive copolymer of methacrylate and acrylate. The {pH} drop after endocytosis hydrolyzes the acetal link between {PEG} and the copolymer. Here, the workers have chosen macrophages, a rather challenging system to work with. Successful manipulation of intracellular trafficking overcame a significant problem in the delivery of protein therapeutics and vaccines. The stimuli exploited in release systems include magnetic fields, ultrasonic radiation, electric fields, and presence of specific chemicals [13]. The release systems for naltrexone, amoxicillin, theophyllin, heparin, and calcitonin have been described [13]. The hydrogel-based products already available on the market target varied applications such as in hypertension, end-stage cancer pain, skin care, and wound and burn dressing [13]. One of the earliest applications of {poly(NIPAAm)} in biology was in the area of immunoassays [40]. Miyata et al. [41] synthesized an antigen-antibody semi-interpenetrating network {(semi-IPN)} hydrogel by the copolymerization of vinyl(rabbit {IgG)} (obtained by chemical reaction between {IgG} and N-succinimidylacrylate) and acrylamide, along with {N,Nâ²-methylene} bisacrylamide as a crosslinker in the presence of polymerized goat anti-rabbit {IgG.} The presence of an external antigen leads to the disruption of the intrachain antigen-antibody binding by displacing the bound antigen with the external one, causing the gel to swell {(Figure} 3). The response was reversible and showed âshape-memory effectâ as a consequence of {semi-IPN} structure. Design of such gels requires a tradeoff between rigidity (possible by dense crosslinking) and efficient analyte binding kinetics (shown by loose networks) [42]. In yet another emerging approach, molecular imprinting, by polymerizing stimuli-responsive hydrogel in the presence of the template, imparts analyte sensitivity to the gel and allows memorization of their binding conformation and to be switched on and off by control of the external stimulus [42]. The aims of gene therapy include curing genetic diseases and viral infections, slowing down tumor growth, and stopping neurodegenerative diseases [43]. As the basic principle is inserting the desired genetic material into the cell, finding an efficient method for the delivery of the gene and its sustained expression are crucial steps. While viral vectors are obvious choices and have been used most often so far, immune responses are a great obstacle. Two types of nonviral (synthetic) gene carriers, lipids and polymers, have been used. Both have to be cationic in nature in order to be able to form complexes with the anionic {DNA,} and the complex has to have net positive charge to interact with the anionic cell membrane and undergo endocytosis. The design has to conform to two contradictory requirements during endocytosis. While attaching to the cell and forming endosome, the binding between the carrier and the {DNA} has to be quite high. On the other hand, for {DNA} to move into the nucleus to initiate transcription, the complex should be easy to dissociate. It is here that stimuli-sensitive polymers are uniquely suited to fulfill the dual requirements, as the stimulus can control the binding to {DNA.} Furthermore, selective gene expression is possible in terms of site, timing, and duration by using temperature- or light-responsive polymers. The application of light-sensitive polymers is already illustrated by the use of L-lysine-modified polyazobenzene dendrimer for transfection of mammalian cells [44]. The temperature-responsive polymeric gene carrier utilizing {PNIPAAm} has also been described [45]. A copolymer with an {LCST} of {21Â°C} was mixed with a plasmid {DNA} encoding the Î²-galactosidase gene at {37Â°C,} added to the cells, and subjected to incubation for 3 hr at {20Â°C} after preincubation for 20 hr at {37Â°C.} The transfection efficiency was higher than the control, for which {20Â°C} incubation was missing {(Figure} 4). This was the time period when the carrier formed extended chains and released {DNA.} In an alternative design, the carrier had an {LCST} above body temperature, and heat was applied for dissociation of {DNA.} It may be added that ultrasonic devices allow temperature change with 5 mm precision. Another promising approach has been described by Stayton et al. [46], who found that pinocytosis of polylysine/poly(propylacrylic acid) nanoparticles could increase the transfection efficiency of polylysine/plasmid (expressing the green fluorescent protein) nanoparticles when both are taken up by {NIH3T3} fibroblast cells. Poly(propylacrylic acid) becomes membrane destabilizing as the endosomal {pH} drops. The approach is aimed at enhancing transport across endosomal membrane to get the {DNA} to the right intracellular compartment. A more recent work from the same group shows that the approach works only with late endosomes and not with lysosomes [47]. Also, analogs of the polymer-like poly(2-methylacrylic acid) and poly(2-ethylacrylic acid) are ineffective. Thus, smart polymers provide potential for considerable innovation in designs for nonviral vectors for gene therapy. This assumes extra significance in view of the recent finding that treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency disease with gene therapy based upon retroviral vector is suspected to be associated with cancer risk [48]. Tissue engineering is about delivery of appropriate cells for repair and/or development of new tissue by the use of scaffolds [1 and 49]. Smart hydrogels constitute promising materials for such scaffolds for two reasons. First, their interior environment is aqueous. Second, they can release the cells at the appropriate place in response to a suitable stimulus. The difficulty in sterilizing the loaded hydrogels is an unsolved problem [1]. It has been shown that {PNIPAAm} above {LCST} could attach chondrocytes and release them below {LCST} [49]. A potential application is in repair of damaged cartilage sites as in rheumatoid arthritis. The coculturing of rat hepatocytes and human lung fibroblasts on polystyrene grafted with {PNIPAAm} has been carried out with a view to model studies on cell-cell communication [50]. Polystyrene surfaces and temperature-controlled hydrophobicity of grafted polymers could pick up the two different types of cells selectively. Unlike in most of the other applications, the scaffolds for tissue engineering do not need to show the stimulus-dependent change in a reversible fashion. After the cells are delivered, one does not have to reverse the process. On the other hand, the biodegradability of the scaffold and lack of cytotoxicity and immunogenicity are the required traits [51]. It has also been realized that cells inside such scaffolds need effective cell-cell communications, and hence {3D} constructs of such scaffolds should have appropriate geometries. Many of these considerations once again have led workers to look at biological structures for inspiration. The result has been some very thought-provoking work with self-assembling structures based on peptides, lipids, or hybrid peptide materials. These synthetic peptides also permit incorporation of features that promote cell attachment [51]. An example of a self-assembling peptide is {RAD-16,} a self-complementary amphiphilic peptide [51]. By varying the concentration of the peptide or salt, the former could be assembled to form a hydrogel with the shape of a tape, rope, or sheet {(Figure} 5). Such scaffolds have already been shown to support cell attachment of various mammalian and avian tissue culture cells. Future work will have to address the issue of adequate mechanical strength and controlling cell growth with defined {3D} geometries. At present, the geometries of growing cell patterns can only be controlled in {2D} [52]. The ultimate challenge will, of course, lie in designing âscaffolds that influence cell adhesion, differentiation, and migration of specific cell types to create artificial tissuesâ [51]. Collier and Hessersmith [53] have designed a peptide that self-assembles into fibrillar structures and can further be crosslinked by transglutaminase. The attractive features of this design include the possibility of controlling transglutaminase action by Ca2+ concentration. While the N terminal of the peptide was susceptible to peptide action, the C terminal was tailored for cell attachment. The crosslinking imparted the mechanical strength just as disulphide crosslinks do in native proteins. The enzyme action can also be used in future for the decoration of these predominantly Î²-sheet fibrils with appropriate cell binding ligands or growth factors. The peptides described above do show some limited Î²-sheet structure even in the absence of salt concentration as a stimulus. The extent of this self-assembled structure becomes significant as the concentration of peptide increases. This may turn out to be a problem in real applications. It is not unlikely that a synergy of our understanding of synthetic hydrogels and such biomimetic structures would lead to the design of an ideal scaffold. The Hoffman group has developed the concept of conjugating a stimulus-responsive polymer/hydrogel to a protein at a site near its ligand recognition site [54]. The carefully controlled placement of the polymer ensures that when a stimulus is applied, the collapse/swelling of the gel causes the active site of the protein to be blocked/âgatedâ or unblocked. This can also lead to the release of a small molecular weight ligand from the active site of the protein. In most of the cases, the polymer chosen is {poly(NIPAAm),} and frequently streptavidin (quite often suitably altered by protein engineering) has been the protein used. In one of the early examples, {poly(NIPAAm)} was linked to streptavidin at a site located just above its biotin binding site [54]. When the temperature is raised above the {LCST} of the hydrogel, it collapses, covering the active site. Biotin can no longer bind to streptavidin, thus the polymer effectively acts as a âmolecular gate.â Ding et al. [55] have conjugated {poly(NIPAAm)} to a site near a genetically engineered streptavidin that is involved in binding to biotin and is responsible for favoring the streptavidin-biotin interaction. Temperature-induced collapse of the polymer leads to the release of the bound molecule above its {LCST.} Thus, this streptavidin-polymer conjugate can act as a âtriggerâ for the release of biotin. Using {pH} as the stimulus can also bring about the release of biotin. In this case, a copolymer of acrylic acid and {NIPAAm} is conjugated to a genetically engineered streptavidin at a site near its biotin binding site. Changing the {pH} of the solution brought about the triggered release of biotin. In a novel manner of exploiting this approach, Ding et al. [56] have used the thermally sensitive polymer, {poly(N,N-diethylacrylamide),} and attached it to streptavidin at a site near the biotin binding site. Below its {LCST} {(24Â°C),} the polymer is in an extended coil conformation, thus acting as a âshieldâ and preventing the binding of the biotinylated protein to streptavidin. Using polymers of different sizes, one can control size selectivity of the shields. Hence, these shields can be used to discriminate among a mixture of biotinylated proteins on the basis of size. Collapse of the polymer upon increasing the temperature leads to exposure of the biotin binding site. In a logical extension of this concept to thermal switching of enzyme activity, control of endoglucanase activity by site-directed conjugation of another acrylamide copolymer near the enzyme active site has been described recently [57]. This paper may also be consulted for some strategies for designing molecular switches, including some recent work on {RNA} switches and a redox switch for an endonuclease. The concept of physical blocking of recognition sites by a collapsed form has also been utilized in design of photoswitches for ligand association. This has been shown to work with binding of biotin to streptavidin conjugate of a photoresponsive acrylamide-acrylate copolymer [58]. In a parallel work, photoregulation of endoglucanase activity by conjugation with the same copolymer has also been described [59]. Such molecular switches might be useful in bioprocessing, biosensors, prodrug therpeutic applications, and microfluidics. With a goal to design composite systems by self-assembly for molecular switching, {PNIPAAm} and copolymers were also studied as adsorption layer on colloidal silica [60]. In the restricted geometry of the adsorbed layer, the phase transition was broader than in solution. In the case of the copolymer, {NMR} showed comparatively mobile arrangement even above the transition temperature, which was rightly interpreted in terms of electrostatic repulsion between the matrix and the polymer hindering globule formation. Another interesting recent discovery has been that smart polymers seem to simulate molecular chaperones to assist in correct protein folding [61]. Molecular chaperones act by binding to the protein folding intermediates with exposed hydrophobic residues, thus preventing aggregation and facilitating correct folded structure [62]. The smartness of the polymer is valuable, as the overall hydrophobicity of smart polymers can be varied by applying the appropriate stimulus. Also, it is possible to recycle the polymer by dissociating it from the folded protein molecule. Lin et al. [63] found that {PNIPAAm} increased the final yield of enzyme activity during renaturation of Î²-lactamase from its inclusion bodies. The presence of the polymer did not affect the initial renaturation rate, and the final yield increased with temperature. The latter is in agreement with the assumption that hydrophobicity of the polymer helps in protein folding. In a more recent work by the same group [64] but with guanidine hydrochloride-denatured carbonic anhydrase B, it was confirmed by fluorescence analysis and equilibrium studies that {PNIPAAm} enhances âprotein refolding by the formation of complexes with aggregation-prone folding intermediates via hydrophobic interactions.â An optimal molar ratio of polymer to enzyme was found, since higher polymer concentration led to protein precipitation. These workers also showed that addition of {PNIPAAm} after enzyme aggregation has taken place (within 1 min) did not lead to correct protein folding. Under optimum conditions, a refolding yield of 98.2\% was reported. Kuboi et al. [61] showed that the presence of a thermoresponsive polymer, {PPO-Ph-PEG} {[PEG} containing poly(propylene oxide)phenyl group], increased the refolding yield of (guanidine-hydrochloride-denatured) carbonic anhydrase 1.7 times. It was also found that the polymer/dextran system increased the refolding yield of the enzyme as compared to the {PEG/dextran} system. The fact that {52Â°C} was found to be optimal for this process was significant since (1) local hydrophobicity of the protein increased from {40Â°C} onward, reached maximum around {60Â°C,} and then declined, and (2) local hydrophobicity of the polymer {PPO-Ph-PEG} increased gradually with increasing temperature till {45Â°C,} increased sharply at this phase transition temperature, and ultimately reached a plateau beyond {45Â°C.} Thus, {52Â°C,} within the two values of {45Â°C} and {60Â°C,} presumably reflects the optimum interaction between the hydrophobic sites on the polymer and the enzyme. After the enzyme is refolded to native state, it is released from its complex with the polymer, since the folded protein has far less local hydrophobicity. Somewhat similar results have been obtained by Umakoshi et al. [65] while using a two-phase system consisting of a thermosensitive polymer, Breox (a random copolymer of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide), and dextran or a Breox/water system. It was found that unfolded chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 with a more hydrophobic surface partitioned to the relatively hydrophobic Breox phase in both systems. The inhibitor could be refolded in Breox phase and separated from it by precipitating out the polymer by increasing the temperature. These investigations certainly help in gaining insight into the role of chaperones in protein folding and evolving efficient protein recovery protocols, especially in the case of many overexpressed proteins (inclusion bodies) in Escherischia coli. The concept of lab-in-a-chip has evolved out of efforts to miniaturize analytical instruments. By using photolithography on a chip, one can create microchannels and work with very small volumes. As Mitchell [66] wrote, {âFunctional} complexity brings with it a need to actively switch and control fluids, to change their flow rate and direction at different points on the chip at different stages of the process.â Smart materials show considerable promise in designing microactuators for autonomous flow control inside these microfluidic channels. Saitoh et al. [67] have explored the use of glass capillaries coated with {PNIPAAm} for creating an on/off valve for the liquid flow. Below {LCST,} the {PNIPAAm-coated} capillary {(PNIPAAm} enhances the wettability at these temperatures) allowed the flow of water; above {LCST,} the flow was blocked as the coating was now hydrophobic. Beebe et al. [68], on the other hand, used a {pH-sensitive} methacrylate to control the flow inside the microchannels. The hydrogel-based microfluidic valve opened or closed depending upon the {pH} of the flowing solution. The design has the potential of being self-regulating/autonomous since the valve can be controlled by feedback by H+ produced or consumed in the reaction. A good response time of less than 10 s was reported. Undoubtedly, we will see many other innovative designs for such applications in the coming years. In this review, we have provided only a glimpse into the complexities and utility of smart polymeric biomaterials; however, with this snapshot we have strived to illustrate the versatility and potential of these materials. Indeed, one could postulate that the versatility of smart materials is limited only by the imaginations of their designers and by the scientists who use them. Interestingly, a recently published article discussing the âintelligenceâ of smart materials hypothesized that if current smart materials were rated using a standard {IQ} test, they would have an {IQ} of 2 [69]âimpressive for inanimate compounds. And researchers are continuing to develop smarter, more useful compoundsâwe like to think that we are getting closer to designing T-1000 (the robot from Terminator 2: Judgment Day that changes from solid to liquid) [70]. One may question the reasoning of our goal of developing novel smart polymers to perform chemical and biological functions, since existing natural compounds can already meet these needs. We argue that purposefully designed biomaterials offer additional attractions such as predictability (a designed artificial polymer is a known entity) as well as an improved ability to manipulate desirable (and undesirable) traits present in assays. Drug design and medicine will profit both financially and in terms of providing high quality health care, with the ability to precisely craft artificial organs and drug delivery vehicles that âintelligentlyâ interface with cells and organs. An area of key interest to the smart polymeric biomaterial field is the immune system. For example, using smart materials one could imagine ways to regulate the immune response to control hypersensitivity without impairing the overall immune system. Smart materials are poised for take off and will certainly promise an exciting future at the interface of chemistry and biology.

	abstract = {We present methods that introduce concepts from Rosenbluth sampling {[M.} N. Rosenbluth and A. W. Rosenbluth, J. Chem. Phys. 23, 356 (1955)] into the Jarzynski nonequilibrium work {(NEW)} free-energy calculation technique {[C.} Jarzynski, Phys. Rev. Lett. 78, 2690 (1997)]. The proposed hybrid modifies the way steps are taken in the {NEW} process. With it, each step is selected from a range of alternatives, with bias given to steps that contribute the least work. The definition of the work average is modified to account for the bias. We introduce two variants of this method, lambda-bias sampling and configuration-bias sampling, respectively; a combined lambda- and configuration-bias method is also considered. By reducing the likelihood that large nonequilibrated work values enter the ensemble average, the Rosenbluth sampling aids in remedying problems of inaccuracy of the calculation. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods through a model system of N independent harmonic oscillators. This model captures the difficulties involved in calculating free energies in real systems while retaining many tractable features that are helpful to the study. We examine four variants of this model that differ qualitatively in the nature of their phase-space overlap. Results indicate that the lambda-bias sampling method is most useful for systems with entropic sampling barriers, while the configuration-bias methods are best for systems with energetic sampling barriers. The Rosenbluth-sampling schemes yield much more accurate results than the unbiased nonequilibrium work method. Typically the accuracy can be improved by about an order of magnitude for a given amount of sampling; this improvement translates into two or more orders of magnitude less sampling required to obtain a given level of accuracy, owing to the generally slow convergence of the {NEW} calculation when the inaccuracy is large.},

An automated setup is presented, which allows for the use of the method in an industrial setting. Calculations are performed for four realistic examples, retinoic acid receptor , matrix metalloprotease 3, estrogen receptor , and dihydrofolate reductase, focusing on different aspects of the procedure. The obtained {LIE} models are evaluated in terms of the root-mean-square {(RMS)} errors from experimental binding free energies and the ability to rank compounds appropriately. The results are compared to the best empirical scoring function, selected from a set of 10 scoring functions. In all cases, good {LIE} models can be obtained in terms of free-energy {RMS} errors, although reasonable ranking of the ligands of dihydrofolate reductase proves difficult for both the {LIE} method and scoring functions. For the other proteins, the {LIE} model results in better predictions than the best performing scoring function. These results indicate that the {LIE} approach, as a tool to evaluate docking results, can be a valuable asset in computational lead optimization programs.},

	volume = {122},
	abstract = {Monte Carlo {(MC)} statistical mechanics simulations have been carried out for more than 200 organic solutes, including 125 drugs and related heterocycles, in aqueous solution. The calculations were highly automated and used the {OPLS-AA} force field augmented with {CM1P} partial charges. Configurationally averaged results were obtained for a variety of physically significant quantities including the solute-water Coulomb and {Lennard-Jones} interaction energies, solvent-accessible surface area {(SASA),} and numbers of donor and acceptor hydrogen bonds. Correlations were then obtained between these descriptors and gas to liquid free energies of solvation in hexadecane, octanol, and water and octanol/water partition coefficients. Linear regressions with three or four descriptors yielded fits with correlation coefficients, r(2), of 0.9 in all cases. The regression equation for log P(octanol/water) only needs four descriptors to provide an rms error of 0.55 for 200 diverse compounds, which is competitive with the best fragment methods. For water, the expanded data set of 85 solutes and improved statistical analyses bring into question the significance of the {Lennard-Jones} and surface area terms that have been featured in prior linear-response treatments. The results are sensitive to the choice of partial charges for the solute atoms; poor representation of some functional groups can lead to the need for specific corrections in the regression equations. This is expected to also be true for force-field-based scoring functions for protein-ligand binding. In all cases, the present descriptors that emerge as most significant sensibly reveal the key physical factors that control solvation, especially solute size in organic solvents and electrostatic interactions in water. Furthermore, additional {MC} simulations for solutes in both water and ethanol clearly demonstrate that the key differential between water and alcohols is the greater hydrogren-bond-donating ability of water, which explains the significance of a solute's hydrogen-bond-accepting; ability for log P(octanol/water).},

Combining lessons learned in previous studies, an application of the method is presented that allows for the calculation of relative binding free energies for structurally rather diverse compounds from only a few simulations. Based on the well known statistical mechanical perturbation formula, the results do not require any empirical parameters, or training sets, only limited knowledge of the binding characteristics of the ligands suffices to design appropriate reference compounds. Depending on the choice of reference compound, relative free energies of binding rigid ligands to the ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor can be obtained that show good agreement with the experimental values. The approach presented here can easily be applied to many rigid ligands, and it should be relatively easy to extend the method to account for ligand flexibility. The free-energy calculations can be straightforwardly parallelized, allowing for an efficient means to understand and predict relative binding free energies.},

Free-energy calculations based on classical molecular-dynamics simulations of the protein and from mutants in aqueous solution at different {pH} values were used to compute relative redox potentials. The precision of the free-energy calculations with the ? coupling-parameter approach is evaluated as function of the number and sequence of ? values, the sampling time and initial conditions. It is found that the precision is critically dependent on the relaxation of hydrogen-bonding networks when changing the atomic-charge distribution due to a change of redox state or {pH} value. The errors in the free energies range from 1 to 10 {kBT,} depending on the type of process. Only qualitative estimates of the change in redox potential by protein mutation can be obtained.},

Consequently, the pivot property to which the parameters were adjusted, the location of the density maximum at 1 atm, does not agree with experimental values.

The analysi s reveals differences in the binding energy landscapes of two molecular fragments with the {FKBP12} protein, which are reflected in their characteristic transition temperatures. The approach provides insight into the nature of transitions between unbound an d bound phases of ligand-protein complexes. One molecular fragment proceeds from the unbound phase to the native complex via a short-lived intermediate at relatively high temperature. The second fragment has a significantly more rugged binding energy land scape and goes from unbound to a long-lived nonspecific bound species consisting of isoenergetic yet structurally different binding modes, and later via a second-order-like transition to the native complex.

Major stumbling blocks for achieving this goal reflect the difficulty of sampling in a known fashion along the reaction coordinate and of maximally combining information that has been collected from the simulation along the reaction coordinate. In this paper we examine the utility of a probability density functional type fit to the distribution of work events collected during a nonequilibrium sample along the reaction coordinate. This approach can readily be generalized to equilibrium sampling and has the potential to estimate the quality of a relative free energy estimate as data are being collected. The method may have the greatest utility for nonequilibrium sampling where {non-Gaussian} work distributions are generally present that are strongly dominated by rare event sampling in the tail region. We believe that the approach can be used to augment the design and the error analysis of relative free energy computations thus improving the ability to reliably and with known accuracy compute a relative free energy.},

These macroscopic modeling tasks, yielding information over long time and large space scales, are accomplished through appropriately initialized calls to the microscopic simulator for only short times and small spatial domains. Our equation-free {(EF)} approach, when successful, can bypass the derivation of the macroscopic evolution equations when these equations conceptually exist but are not available in closed form. We discuss how the mathematics-assisted development of a computational superstructure may enable alternative descriptions of the problem physics (e.g. Lattice Boltzmann {(LB),} kinetic Monte Carlo {(KMC)} or Molecular Dynamics {(MD)} microscopic simulators, executed over relatively short time and space scales) to perform systems level tasks (integration over relatively large time and space scales,âcoarseâ bifurcation analysis, optimization, and control) directly. In effect, the procedure constitutes a systems identification based, âclosure on demandâ computational toolkit, bridging microscopic/stochastic simulation with traditional continuum scientific computation and numerical analysis. We illustrate these ideas through examples from chemical kinetics {(LB,} {KMC),} rheology {(Brownian} Dynamics), homogenization and the computation of âcoarsely self-similarâ solutions, and discuss various features, limitations and potential extensions of the approach.},

An {MMPB/SA-type} analysis was applied to conformational samples from 3 ns explicit solvent molecular dynamics simulations of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes. Binding affinities and the sampled conformations of the inhibitor and enzyme were compared between different {HIV-1} protease protonation states to find the most likely protonation state of the enzyme in the complex with each of the inhibitors. The resulting set of protonation states leads to good agreement between calculated and experimental binding affinities. Results from the {MMPB/SA} analysis are compared with an explicit/implicit hybrid scheme and with {MMGB/SA} methods. It is found that the inclusion of explicit water molecules may offer a slight advantage in reproducing absolute binding free energies while the use of the Generalized Born approximation significantly affects the accuracy of the calculated binding affinities. {\textbackslash}copyright 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs; for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a {Multiple-Program,} {Multiple-Data} approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions.

Here we extend our earlier model of folding free energy landscapes, in which each residue is considered to be either folded as in the native state or completely disordered, by investigating the role of additional factors representing hydrogen bonding and backbone torsion strain, and by using a hybrid between the master equation approach and the simple transition state theory to evaluate kinelics near the free energy barrier in greater detail. Model calculations of folding phi-values are compared to experimental data for 19 proteins, and for more than half of these, experimental data are reproduced with correlation coefficients between r = 0.41 and 0.88; calculations of transition state free energy barriers correlate with rates measured for 37 single domain proteins (r = 0.69). The model provides insight into the contribution of alternative-folding pathways, the validity of quasi-equilibrium treatments of the folding landscape, and the magnitude of the Arrhenius prefactor for protein folding. Finally, we discuss the limitations of simple native-state-based models, and as a more general test of such models, provide predictions of folding rates and mechanisms for a comprehensive set of over 400 small protein domains of known structure.},

We analyze the behavior of {FEP} calculations in terms of the perturbation-energy distribution functions, and present several routes to characterize the calculations in terms of these distributions.

The X-ray structure of {FBPase} complexed with 5-aminoimidazole- {4-carboxamide-1-{\textasciicircum}@-D-ribofuranosyl} 5'-monophosphate {(ZMP)} provided structural information used for subsequent analogue design and free energy calculations. The {FEP} protocol was validated by calculating the free energy differences for the mutation of {ZMP} (1) to {AMP} (2). The calculated results showed a net gain of 1.7 kcal/mol, which agreed with the experimental result of 1.3 kcal/mol. {FEP} calculations were performed for 18 other {AMP} analogues. Inhibition constants were determined for over half of these analogues, usually after completion of the calculation, and were consistent with the predictions. Solvation free energy differences between {AMP} and various {AMP} analogues proved to be an important factor in binding free energies, suggesting that increased desolvation costs associated with the addition of polar groups to an inhibitor must be overcomeby stronger ligand-protein interactions if the structural modification is to enhance inhibitor potency. Theresults indicate that {FEP} calculations predict relative binding affinities with high accuracy and provide valuableinsight into the factors that influence inhibitor binding and therefore should greatly aid efforts to optimizeinitial lead compounds and reduce the time required for the discovery of new drug candidates.},

Encouragingly, the addition of a single V-2 term involving the atoms {C(sp(3))-O-(sp(3))-C(sp(3))-N(sp(2)),} which can be nicely rationalized because of the anomeric effect (lone pairs on oxygen are preferentially oriented relative to the electron withdrawing N), brings the sugar pucker phase of C2'-endo sugars to near perfect agreement with ab initio calculations {(W} near 162 degrees). Secondly, the use of high level ab initio calculations on entire nucleosides (in contrast to smaller model systems necessitated in 1994-95 by computer limitations) lets one improve the chi torsional potential for nucleic acids. Finally, the {O(sp(3))-C(sp(3))-C(sp(3))-O(sp(3))} V-2 torsional potential has been empirically adjusted to reproduce the ab initio calculated relative energy of C2'-endo and C3'-endo nucleosides. These modifications are tested in molecular dynamics simulations of mononucleosides (to assess sugar pucker percentages) and double helices of {DNA} and {RNA} (to assess helical and sequence specific structural properties).

These results are used in a least-squares procedure to determine the numerical values of the corresponding properties of the selected functional groups. The simple first order group contribution method, which in general ignores nearest-neighbors and steric hindrance effects, was chosen to represent the compiled data. Following the precedent established by Cabani em et al. (1981), the following groups are considered: {CH3,} {CH2,} {CH,} C for saturated hydrocarbons; {c-CH2,} {c-CH,} {c-C} for cyclic saturated hydrocarbons; {CH,,} C, for aromatic hydrocarbons (containing the benzene ring); {C=C,} C drop C for double and triple bonds in linear hydrocarbons, respectively; {c-C=C} for the double bond in cyclic hydrocarbons; H for a hydrogen atom attached to the double bond (both in linear and cyclic hydrocarbons) or triple bond; and {OH} for the hydroxyl functional group. In addition it was found necessary to include the âpseudoâ-group {I(C-C)} to account for the specific interactions of the neighboring hydrocarbon groups attached to the benzene or cyclic ring (in the latter case only for cis-isomers).

	abstract = {{HIV} protease inhibitors are a key component of anti-retroviral therapy, but their susceptibility to cytochrome P metabolism reduces their systemic availability and necessitates repetitive dosing. Importantly, failure to maintain adequate inhibitor levels is believed to provide an opportunity for resistance to emerge; thus, new strategies to prolong the lifetime of these drugs are needed. Toward this goal, numerous prodrug approaches have been developed, but these methods involve creating inactive precursors that require enzymatic processing. Using an alternative strategy inspired by the natural product {FK506,} we have synthetically modified an {HIV} protease inhibitor such that it acquires high affinity for the abundant, cytoplasmic chaperone, {FK506-binding} protein {(FKBP).} This modified protease inhibitor maintains activity against {HIV-1} protease {(IC} = 19 {nM)} and, additionally, it is partitioned into the cellular component of whole blood via binding to {FKBP.} Interestingly, redistribution into this protected niche reduces metabolism and improves its half-life in mice by almost 20-fold compared with the unmodified compound. Based on these findings, we propose that addition of {FKBP-binding} groups might partially overcome the poor pharmacokinetic properties of existing {HIV} protease inhibitors and, potentially, other drug classes.},

They are derived from: (1) observed pairing frequencies of the 20 amino acids in databases of known protein structures, and (2) approximations and assumptions about the physical process that these quantities measure. Using exact lattice models, we construct a rigorous test of these assumptions and approximations. We find that statistical potentials often correctly rank-order the relative strengths of interresidue interactions, but they do not reflect the true underlying energies because of systematic errors arising from the neglect of excluded volume in proteins. We find that complex residue-residue distance dependences observed in statistical potentials, even those among charged groups, can be largely explained as an indirect consequence of the burial of non-polar groups. Our results suggest that current statistical potentials may have limited value in protein folding algorithms and wherever they are used to provide energy-like quantities.},

	abstract = {The immune system responds to the introduction of foreign antigens by rapidly evolving antibodies with increasing affinity for the antigen (i.e., maturation). To investigate the factors that control this process at the molecular level, we have assessed the changes in flexibility that accompany ligand binding at four stages of maturation in the 4-4-20 antibody. Our studies, based on molecular dynamics, indicate that increased affinity for the target ligand is associated with a decreased entropic cost to binding. The entropy of binding is unfavorable, opposing favorable enthalpic contributions that arise during complex formation. Computed binding free energies for the various antibodyligand complexes qualitatively reproduce the trends observed in the experimentally derived values, although the absolute magnitude of free-energy differences is overestimated. Our results support the existence of a correlation between high-affinity interactions and decreased protein flexibility in this series of antibody molecules. This observation is likely to be a general feature of molecular association processes and key to the molecular evolution of antibody responses. 10.1073/pnas.0610064104},

	title = {Adaptive inhibitors of the {HIV-1} protease},

	abstract = {A significant obstacle to the efficacy of drugs directed against viral targets is the presence of amino acid polymorphisms in the targeted molecules. Amino acid polymorphisms may occur naturally due to the existence of variations within and between viral strains or as the result of mutations associated with drug resistance. An ideal drug will be one that is extremely effective against a primary target and maintains its effectiveness against the most important variations of the target molecule. A drug that simultaneously inhibits different variants of the target will lead to a faster suppression of the virus, retard the appearance of drug-resistant mutants and provide more efficacious and, in the long range, more affordable therapies. Drug molecules with the ability to inhibit several variants of a target with high affinity have been termed adaptive drugs {(Nat.} Biotechnol. 20 (2002) 15; Biochemistry 42 (2003) 8459; J. Cell. Biochem. S37 (2001) 82). Current drug design paradigms are predicated upon the lock-and-key hypothesis, which emphasizes shape complementarity as a way to attain specificity and improved binding affinity. Shape complementarity is accomplished by the introduction of conformational constraints in the drug molecule. While highly constrained molecules do well against a unique target, they lack the ability to adapt to target variations like those originating from naturally occurring polymorphisms or drug-resistant mutations. Targeting an array of closely related targets rather than a single one while still maintaining selectivity, requires a different approach. A plausible strategy for designing high affinity adaptive inhibitors is to engineer their most critical interactions (for affinity and specificity) with conserved regions of the target while allowing for adaptability through the introduction of flexible asymmetric functionalities in places facing variable regionsof the target. The fundamental thermodynamics and structural principles associated with this approach are discussed in this chapter. {(C)} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Chem. 1996, 100, 8587). Thermodynamic perturbation calculations with explicit solvent were used to determine the absolute solvation free energies. Two separate sets of chloroform simulations were performed differing only in the choice of atomic charges for chloroform and the bases. In the first simulations, labeled as charge set 1 {(CS1),} {RESP} was used with the {RHF/6-31G(3dt,2p)} basis set to determine the chloroform charges and the {RHF/6-31G(*)} basis set to determine the charges for the nucleic acid bases. For the second simulations, labeled as charge set 2 {(CS2),} the {CS1} chloroform charges were scaled down to reproduce the experimental dipole moment in solution, and the {CS1} bases charges were reduced by 10\%. The reduction of the atomic charges in the second model was done to account for the less polarizing environment of chloroform (as compared to water) and yielded a significant improvement in the calculated results. The partition coefficients calculated from {CS1} yielded an average absolute error of 1.5 log units compared to experiment, where in contrast, {CS2} shows good agreement, with an average absolute error of only 0.5 log units.},

In principle, {TS} should also be a good target for drugs used to fight infectious disease. In practice, {TS} is highly conserved across species, and it has proven to be difficult to develop inhibitors that are selective for microbial {TS} enzymes over the human enzyme. Using the structure of {TS} from Lactobacillus casei in complex with the nonsubstrate analogue phenolphthalein, inhibitors were designed to take advantage of features of the bacterial enzyme that differ from those of the human enzyme. Upon synthesis and testing, these inhibitors were found to be up to 40-fold selective for the bacterial enzyme over the human enzyme. The crystal structures of two of these inhibitors in complex with {TS} suggested the design of further compounds. Subsequent synthesis and testing showed that these second-round compounds inhibit the bacterial enzyme at sub-micromolar concentrations, while the human enzyme was not inhibited at detectable levels (selectivities of 100-1000-fold or greater). Although these inhibitors share chemical similarities, X-ray crystal structures reveal that the analogues bind to the enzyme in substantially different orientations. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggest that the individual inhibitors may adopt multiple configurations in their complexes with {TS.}},

The results of this approach agree well with experimentally observed binding affinities. Also assessed is a commonly used approximate endpoint approach, which separately estimates enthalpy, solvation free energy, and entropy. We show that this endpoint approach has numerous variations, all of which are prone to critical shortcomings. For example, conventional harmonic and quasiharmonic entropy estimation procedures produce disparate results for the relatively simple protein-ligand systems studied in this work.},

The average absolute error for the former was 2.9 {kJ} mol(-1) and for the latter was 3.5 {kJ} mol(-1). The linear response method was then used to predict free energies of hydration based on the average van der Waals and electrostatic solute-solvent energies obtained from Monte Carlo computer simulations and solvent accessible surface areas. Use of the three parameter relationship gave a good agreement with the experiment. However, a number of simpler fitting functions were also examined and found to be only marginally less reliable. A careful statistical analysis of the linear response method is therefore needed. {(C)} 1999 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	volume = {110},
	abstract = {The use of Ewald and related methods to handle electrostatic interactions in explicit-solvent simulations of solutions imposes an artificial periodicity on systems which are inherently nonperiodic. The consequences of this approximation should be assessed, since they may crucially affect the reliability of those computer simulations. In the present study, we propose a general method based on continuum electrostatics to investigate the nature and magnitude of periodicity-induced artifacts. As a first example, this scheme is applied to the solvation free-energy of a spherical ion. It is found that artificial periodicity reduces the magnitude of the ionic solvation free-energy, because the solvent in the periodic copies of the central unit cell is perturbed by the periodic copies of the ion, thus less available to solvate the central ion. In the limit of zero ionic radius and infinite solvent permittivity, this undersolvation can be corrected by adding the Wigner self-energy term to the solvation free-energy. For ions of a finite size or a solvent of finite permittivity, a further correction is needed. An analytical expression for this correction is derived using continuum electrostatics. As a second example, the effect of artificial periodicity on the potential of mean force for the interaction between two spherical ions is investigated. It is found that artificial periodicity results in an attractive force between ions of like charges, and a repulsive force between ions of opposite charges. The analysis of these two simple test cases reveals that two individually large terms, the periodicity-induced perturbations of the Coulomb and solvation contributions, often cancel each other significantly, resulting in an overall small perturbation. Three factors may prevent this cancellation to occur and enhance the magnitude of periodicity-induced artifacts: (i) a solvent of low dielectric permittivity, (ii) a solute cavity of non-negligible size compared to the unit cell size, and (iii) a solute bearing a large overall charge. {(C)} 1999 American Institute of Physics. {[S0021-9606(99)50104-9].}},

The results of these calculations indicate that (1) using {FEP,} the single topology approach is more efficient than the dual topology approach for all but very long simulations; (2) using {TI,} the single topology approach is considerably more efficient than the dual topology approach for relatively short simulations, while the two methods are of comparable efficiency for long Simulations; and (3) {TI} and {FEP} are comparably efficient with the single topology technique, but {TI} is more efficient when the dual topology method is used. The results here indicate that {\textgreater}700 ps of total sampling is required to obtain a converged free energy result for this relatively simple model system.},

	volume = {123},
	abstract = {We consider staged free-energy calculation methods in the context of phase-space overlap relations, and argue that the selection of work-based methods should be guided by consideration of the phase-space overlap of the systems of interest. Stages should always be constructed such that work is performed only into a system that has a phase-space subset relation with the starting system. Thus multiple stages are required if the systems of interest are not such that one forms a phase-space subset with the other. Three two-stage methods are possible, termed umbrella sampling, overlap sampling, and funnel sampling. The last is appropriate for cases in which the subset relation holds, but only in the extreme, meaning that one system's important phase space constitutes a very small portion of the others. Umbrella sampling is most suitable for nonoverlap systems, and overlap sampling is appropriate for systems exhibiting partial phase-space overlap. We review recently introduced metrics that characterize phase-space overlap, showing that the performance of the single- and two-stage methods is consistent with the phase-space picture. We also demonstrate that a recently introduced bias-detection measure is effective in identifying inaccuracy in single- and multistage calculations. The examples used are the chemical-potential calculation for a {Lennard-Jones} liquid at moderate and at high densities, the same for model water at ambient conditions, and a process of charging a neutral ion in water.},

Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble were carried out to determine the vapor-liquid coexistence curves for methane to dodecane using three united-atom force fields: {OPLS} {[Jorgensen,} et al. J. Am. Chem. Sec. 1984, 106, 813], {SKS} {[Siepmann,} et al. Nature 1993, 365, 330], and {TraPPE.} Standard specific densities and the high-pressure equation-of-state for the transferable potentials for phase equilibria {(TraPPE)} model were studied by simulations in the isobaric-isothermal and canonical ensembles, respectively. It is found that one set of methyl and methylene parameters is sufficient to accurately describe the fluid phases of all n-alkanes with two or more carbon atoms. Whereas other n-alkane force fields employ methyl groups that an either equal or larger in size than the methylene groups, it is demonstrated here that using a smaller methyl group yields a better fit to the set of experimental data. As should be expected from an effective pair potential, the new parameters do not reproduce experimental second virial coefficients. Saturated vapor pressures and densities show small, but systematic deviation from the experimental data.},

In contrast to that, the present paper focuses on the inverse problem: given the system as a whole, identify the almost invariant aggregates together with the (small) probabilities of transitions between them. A robust algorithm is worked out on the basis of some detailed perturbation analysis and illustrated at a simple molecular system.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations of united atom {Lennard-Jones} model for methane, ethane, and propane in {TIP3P} water have been used to estimate the chemical potentials of aqueous methane, ethane, and propane from 600 to 1200 degrees C and densities from 0 to 1 g cm(-3). Errors in the simulation itself are negligible. Estimates of the errors in the predictions due to the inadequacy of the models show that this method of prediction gives reasonable accuracy. The calculations are not sensitive to the dipole moment of the water molecule or to the well depth (epsilon) of the water-methane interaction. The diameter (sigma) of the water-methane interaction is the most important parameter. The present predictions for methane are compared with a variety of other methods from the literature. An equation with seven adjustable parameters is presented which fits all of the simulation results as a function of temperature, density of water, and number of carbon atoms. This equation should allow reasonable extrapolations to predict the properties of butane, pentane, and hexane. An even simpler equation with only two adjustable parameters is able to fit all of the experimental data in this temperature and density region if the calculated solute-water second virial coefficient fur this model is used. The fit is not quite as accurate as with the seven-parameter equation, but this equation should be useful for predictions of normal and branched hydrocarbons, Equations of state can give good predictions which are more accurate than those of Shock et al. {(Giochem.} Cosmochim.

	volume = {25},
	copyright = {(c)2004 Institute for Scientific Information, Inc.},
	abstract = {Computational studies of proteins based on empirical force fields represent a powerful tool to obtain structure-function relationships at an atomic level, and are central in current efforts to solve the protein folding problem. The results from studies applying these tools are, however, dependent on the quality of the force fields used. In particular, accurate treatment of the peptide backbone is crucial to achieve representative conformational distributions in simulation studies. To improve the treatment of the peptide backbone, quantum mechanical {(QM)} and molecular mechanical {(MM)} calculations were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and proline dipeptides, and the results from these calculations were combined with molecular dynamics {(MD)} simulations of proteins in crystal and aqueous environments. {QM} potential energy maps of the alanine and glycine dipeptides at the {LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G*} levels, where x = D, T, and Q, were determined, and are compared to available {QM} studies on these molecules. The {LMP2/ce-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G*} energy surfaces for all three dipeptides were then used to improve the {MM} treatment of the dipeptides. These improvements included additional parameter optimization via Monte Carlo simulated annealing and extension of the potential energy function to contain peptide backbone phi, psi dihedral crossterms or a phi, psi grid-based energy correction term. Simultaneously, {MD} simulations of up to seven proteins in their crystalline environments were used to validate the force field enhancements. Comparison with {QM} and crystallographic data showed that an additional optimization of the phi, psi dihedral parameters along with the grid-based energy correction were required to yield significant improvements over the {CHARMM22} force field. However, systematic deviations in the treatment of phi and psi in the helical and sheet regions were evident. Accordingly, empirical adjustments were made to the grid-based energy correction for alanine and glycine to account for these systematic differences. These adjustments lead to greater deviations from {QM} data for the two dipeptides but also yielded improved agreement. with experimental crystallographic data. These improvements enhance the quality of the {CHARMM} force field in treating proteins. This extension of the potential energy function is anticipated to facilitate improved treatment of biological macromolecules via {MM} approaches in general. {(C)} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Four different methods for controlling the temperature of the system were studied. and the effects of these methods on the bulk properties for liquid water were analyzed. The system size was also found to change the dynamics of the model liquid water, Two control simulations with the {SPC/E} water model were carried out.

	abstract = {A method is presented for extracting the configurational entropy of solute molecules from molecular dynamics simulations, in which the entropy is computed as an expansion of multidimensional mutual information terms, which account for correlated motions among the various internal degrees of freedom of the molecule. The mutual information expansion is demonstrated to be equivalent to estimating the full-dimensional configurational probability density function {(PDF)} using the generalized Kirkwood superposition approximation {(GKSA).} While the mutual information expansion is derived to the full dimensionality of the molecule, the current application uses a truncated form of the expansion in which all fourth- and higher-order mutual information terms are neglected. Truncation of the mutual information expansion at the nth order is shown to be equivalent to approximating the full-dimensional {PDF} using joint {PDFs} with dimensionality of n or smaller by successive application of the {GKSA.} The expansion method is used to compute the absolute (classical) configurational entropy in a basis of bond-angle-torsion internal coordinates for several small molecules as well as the change in entropy upon binding for a small host-guest system. Convergence properties of the computed entropy values as a function of simulation time are investigated and comparisons are made with entropy values from the second generation Mining Minima software. These comparisons demonstrate a deviation in {TS} of no more than about 2 kcal/mol for all cases in which convergence has been obtained},

	volume = {41},
	abstract = {Monte Carlo {(MC)} simulations in combination with a linear response approach were used to estimate the free energies of binding for a series of 12 {TIBO} nonnucleoside inhibitors of {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase. Separate correlations were made for the R6 and S6 absolute conformations of the inhibitors, as well as for the analogous N6-monoprotonated species. Models based upon the neutral unbound inhibitors produced overall better fits to experimental values than did those using the protonated unbound inhibitors, with only slight differences between the neutral R6 and S6 cases. The best results were obtained with a three-parameter linear response equation containing van der Waals (alpha), electrostatic (beta), and solvent accessible surface area {(SASA,} gamma) terms. The averaged {(R6} and S6) rms error was approximately 0.88 kcal/mol for the observed range of 4.06 kcal/mol in inhibitor activities. The averaged values of alpha, beta, and gamma were -0.150, 0.114, and 0. 0286, respectively. Omission of the alpha term gave beta 0.152 and gamma 0.022 with a rms of 0.92. The unweighted van der Waals components were found to be highly attractive but failed to correlate well across the series of inhibitors. Contrastingly, while the electrostatic components are all repulsive, they show a direct correlation with inhibitor activity as measured by {DeltaGbinding.} The role of gamma is primarily to produce an overall negative binding energy, and it can effectively be replaced with a negative constant. During the {MC} simulations of the unbound solvated inhibitors, the R6 and S6 absolute conformations do not interconvert due to the formation of a favorable hydrogen bond to solvent. In the complex, however, interconversion of these conformations of the inhibitor is observed during the course of the simulations, a phenomenon which is apparently not observed in the crystalline state of the complex. Hydrogen bonding of the inhibitor to the backbone {NH} of K101 and the lack of such an interaction with the {C=O} of K101 or with solvent correlate with enhanced activity, as does the ability to assume a number of different orientations of the inhibitor dimethylallyl moiety with respect to residues Y181 and Y188 while retaining contact with W229. Overall, the use of a combination of {MC} simulation with a linear response method shows promise as a relatively rapid means of estimating inhibitor activities. This approach should be useful in the preliminary evaluation of potential modifications to known inhibitors to enhance activity.},

The impact of 'hot' and 'cold' errors in ligand mutations on the thermodynamic stability of the native {MTX-DHFR} complex is analyzed, and relationships between the molecular recognition mechanism and the degree of ligand optimization are discussed. The nature and relative stability of intermediat es and thermodynamic phases on the ligand-protein association pathway are studied, providing new insights into connections between protein folding and molecular recognition mechanisms, and cooperativity of ligand-protein binding. The results of kinetic do cking simulations are rationalized based on the thermodynamic properties determined from equilibrium simulations and the Shape of the underlying binding energy landscape. We show how evolutionary ligand selection for a receptor active site can produce wel l-optimized ligand-protein systems such as {MTX-DHFR} complex with the thermodynamically stable native structure and a direct transition mechanism of binding from unbound conformations to the unique native structure.

Here we apply alchemical free energy calculations in explicit solvent to predict ligand binding in a model cavity in T4 lysozyme. Even in this simple site, there are challenges. We made systematic improvements, beginning with single poses from docking, then including multiple poses, additional protein conformational changes, and using an improved charge model. Computed absolute binding free energies had an {RMS} error of 1.9 kcal/mol relative to previously determined. experimental values. In blind prospective tests, the methods correctly discriminated between several true ligands and decoys in a set of putative binders identified by docking. In these prospective tests, the {RMS} error in predicted binding free energies relative to those subsequently determined experimentally was only 0.6 kcal/mol. X-ray crystal structures of the new ligands bound in the cavity corresponded closely to predictions from the free energy calculations, but sometimes differed from those predicted by docking. Finally, we examined the impact of holding the protein rigid, as in docking, with a view to learning how approximations made in docking affect accuracy and how they may be improved.

Math. 54 (2001) 891] are developed here. In this procedure, reduced stochastic equations for a smaller collections of resolved variables are derived systematically for complex nonlinear systems with many degrees of freedom and a large collection of unresolved variables. While the above approach is mathematically rigorous in the limit when the ratio of correlation times between the resolved and the unresolved variables is arbitrary small, it is shown here on a systematic hierarchy of models that this ratio can be surprisingly big. Typically, the systematic reduced stochastic modeling yields quantitatively realistic dynamics for ratios as large asâ2. The examples studied here vary from instructive stochastic triad models to prototype complex systems with many degrees of freedom utilizing the truncated {BurgersâHopf} equations as a nonlinear heat bath. Systematic quantitative tests for the stochastic modeling procedure are developed here which involve the stationary distribution and the two-time correlations for the second and fourth moments including the resolved variables and the energy in the resolved variables. In an important illustrative example presented here, the nonlinear original system involves 102 degrees of freedom and the reduced stochastic model predicted by the theory for two resolved variables involves both nonlinear interaction and multiplicative noises. Even for large value of the correlation time ratio of the order ofâ2, the reduced stochastic model with two degrees of freedom captures the essentially nonlinear and {non-Gaussian} statistics of the original nonlinear systems with 102 modes extremely well. Furthermore, it is shown here that the standard regression fitting of the second-order correlations alone fails to reproduce the nonlinear stochastic dynamics in this example. {\textbackslash}copyright 2002 Elsevier Science {B.V.} All rightsreserved.},

Despite these s imilarities, L-685,818 is a potent antagonist of both the immunosuppressive and toxic effects of the drug. Here, we present a structural analysis of this problem. Although {FK-506} and L-685,818 differ greatly in pharmacology, we have found that the three-d imensional structures of their complexes with {FKBP12} are essentially identical. Approximately half of each ligand is in contact with the receptor protein, and half is exposed to solvent; the exposed region includes the two sites where the compounds differ . These results indicate that the profound differences in the pharmacology of these two compounds are not caused by any difference in their interaction with {FKBP12.} Rather, these effects arise because relatively minor changes in the exposed part of a boun d ligand have a strong effect on how {FKBP12-ligand} complexes interact with calcineurin, their putative intracellular target. In addition, {FK-506} complexes with {FKBP12} proteins from several species all inhibit mammalian calcineurin. Analysis of the three-d imensional structure of the complex with respect to residues conserved among these proteins suggests a small number of surface residues near the bound ligands that may play a critical role in interactions between the protein-drug complex and calcineurin.},

An effective drug molecule often must bind with high specificity to its intended target in the body; lower specificity implies the possibility of significant binding to unintended partners, which could instigate deleterious side effects. However, if the target is a rapidly mutating agent, a drug that is too specific will quickly lose its efficacy by not binding well to functional mutants. Therefore, in molecular design, it is crucial to tailor the binding specificity of a drug to the problem at hand. In practice, specificity is often studied on a case-by-case basis, and it is difficult to create general understanding of the determinants of specificity from the union of such available cases. In this work, we undertook a comprehensive, general study of molecular binding with emphasis on understanding the determinants of specificity from a physical standpoint.

The application of this method leads to a broad energy distribution in a large energy range and a quickly converged sampling of molecular configurations. In the second stage of simulations, the configuration space of the system is divided into a number of small regions according to preselected collective coordinates. An enhanced sampling of reactive transition paths is then performed in a self-adaptive fashion to accelerate kinetics calculations.},

Numerical fluctuations can introduce large uncertainties, limiting the domain of application of the method. The parametric energy function describing the chemical modification in the thermodynamic integration, the âalchemical pathâ, determines the amplitudes of the fluctuations. In the present work, I propose a measure of the fluctuations in the thermodynamic integration and an approach to search for a parametric energy path minimizing that measure. The optimal path derived with this approach is very close to the theoretical minimum of the measure, but produces nonergodic sampling. Nevertheless, this path is used to guide the design of a practical and efficient path producing correct sampling. The convergence with this practical path is evaluated on test cases, and compares favorably with that of other methods such as power or polynomial path, soft-core van der Waals, and some other approaches presented in the literature.

	abstract = {Errors in free energies for molecular replacement and for conformation change of a small model peptide have been determined empirically by repeated simulations from different starting points. All calculations have been done using thermodynamic integration, in which the system's potential energy is coupled to a parameter-lambda that is increased or decreased by a small amount at each step of the simulation. The effects of several factors that may alter the precision are evaluated. These factors include: the length of the simulation, the dependence of the potential energy on lambda, the use of conformational restraints, and their magnitude and form. The methods used for restraint and conformational forcing are described in detail. The free energy change, calculated as the mean from several successive simulations with alternately increasing and decreasing-lambda, is found to be independent of the length of the simulations. As expected, longer simulations produce more precise results. The variation of the calculated free energies is found to consist of two parts, a random error and a systematic hysteresis, i.e., a dependence on the direction in which lambda-changes. The hysteresis varies as the inverse of the length of the simulation and the random error as the inverse square root. The advantage of the use of a different (nonlinear) dependence of the attractive and repulsive parts of the nonbonded potential energy on the coupling parameter when 'creating' particles in solution is found to be very large. This nonlinear coupling was found to be superior to the use of linear coupling and a nonlinear change of the coupling parameter with the simulation time. The hysteresis in conformational free energy calculations is found to increase markedly if too weak a forcing restraint is chosen. It is shown how to deconvolute the contribution of a torsional restraint from the dependence of the free energy on a torsion angle.},

Such a goal may be accomplished by one drug molecule that recognizes multiple variants or by a drug âcocktailâî¸a small collection of drug molecules that collectively binds all desired variants. Ideally, one wants the smallest cocktail possible due to the potential for increased toxicity with each additional drug.

The adequacy of the expanded ensemble method is assessed by computing the interfacial tension of the planar vapor-liquid interface of {Lennard-Jones,} {Lennard-Jones} dimers, {Gay-Berne,} and square-well model fluids; in the latter, the interactions are discontinuous and the present method does not exhibit the asymmetry of other related methods, such as the test area.

The method is valid for deterministic or stochastic Markov dynamics and for stationary or time-dependent distributions. A practical {Rayleigh-Ritz} procedure is advanced, whose inputs are a finitely parametrized Ansatz for the trial states, leading to a parametric action for their evolution. The {Euler-Lagrange} equations of the action principle are Hamiltonian in form generally noncanonical. This permits a simple identification of fixed points as critical points of the parametric Hamiltonian. We also establish a variational principle for low-order statistics, such as mean values and correlation functions, by means of the least effective action. The latter is a functional of the given variable, which is positive and convex as a consequence of Holder realizability inequalities. Its value measures the cost for a fluctuation from the average to occur and in a weak-noise limit it reduces to the {Onsager-Machlup} action. In general, the effective action is shown to arise from the nonequilibrium action functional by a constrained variation. This result provides a {Rayleigh-Ritz} scheme for calculating just the desired low-order statistics, with internal consistency checks less demanding than for the full distribution.},

Input to the model is the distribution of work values underlying the {NEW} calculation, and the bias is estimated by assuming that all of the inaccuracy is incurred by failure to sample work values beyond a specific point in the tail of the distribution. The model is formulated considering both small- and large-sample {NEW} calculations. It is then applied to the study of bias for cases in which the work distribution is Gaussian. The model is shown to give an excellent description of the bias in situations where the bias is a more significant source of error than the sample variance. A scaling law is presented and it is shown that the bias as a function of sampling can be reduced to a single universal curve, approximately valid for all Gaussian work distributions. This result is used to formulate a simple criterion that can be applied to test if a {NEW} calculation is effectively free of bias. The criterion is shown to be effective even though it uses the measured (and perhaps biased) free energy as an input.},

In this work, efficient expanded ensemble methods are described to overcome the lack of ergodicity that often plagues such molecular moves, wherein an arbitrary physical parameter Lambda is used to gradually couple and decouple a partial molecule to and from the system. In particular, we describe the use of (1) acceptance ratio methods for the robust estimation of free-energy changes associated with transitions between Lambda states of the partial molecule, (2) {non-Boltzmann} sampling of the probability density of Lambda states so that one can achieve either a flat histogram or an optimized histogram based on the maximization of round trips between the Lambda bounds, and (3) an approach to select suitable intermediate stages of the Lambda parameter that maximizes such round trips. The validity of the advocated methods is demonstrated by their application to two model systems, namely, the solvation of large hard spheres into a fluid of small spheres, and the mesophase formation of a block copolymer-homopolymer mixture.},

An automated setup is presented, which allows for the use of the method in an industrial setting. Calculations are performed for four realistic examples, retinoic acid receptor , matrix metalloprotease 3, estrogen receptor , and dihydrofolate reductase, focusing on different aspects of the procedure. The obtained {LIE} models are evaluated in terms of the root-mean-square {(RMS)} errors from experimental binding free energies and the ability to rank compounds appropriately. The results are compared to the best empirical scoring function, selected from a set of 10 scoring functions. In all cases, good {LIE} models can be obtained in terms of free-energy {RMS} errors, although reasonable ranking of the ligands of dihydrofolate reductase proves difficult for both the {LIE} method and scoring functions. For the other proteins, the {LIE} model results in better predictions than the best performing scoring function.

	abstract = {The sensitivity of aqueous solvation free energies {(SFEs),} estimated using the {GB/SA} continuum solvent model, on charge sets, protocols, and force fields, was studied. Simple energy calculations using the {GB/SA} solvent model were performed on 11 monofunctional organic compounds. Results indicate that calculated {SFEs} are strongly dependent on the charge sets. Charges derived from electrostatic potential fitting to high level ab initio wave functions using the {CHELPG} procedure and âclass {IVâ} charges from {AM1/CM1a} or {PM3/CM1p} calculations yielded better results than the corresponding Mulliken charges. Calculated {SFEs} were similar to {MC/FEP} energies obtained in the presence of explicit {TIP4P} water. Further improvements were obtained by using {GVB/6-31G**} and {MP2/6-31} G** {(CHELPG)} charge sets that included correlation effects. {SFEs} calculated using charge sets assigned by the {OPLSA*} force field gave the best results of all standard force fields {(MM2*,} {MM3*,} {MMFF,} {AMBER*,} and {OPLSA*)} implemented in {MacroModel.} Comparison of relative and absolute {SFEs} computed using either the {GB/SA} continuum model or {MC/FEP} calculations in the presence of explicit {TIP4P} water showed that, in general, relative {SFEs} can be estimated with greater accuracy. A second set of 20 mono-and difunctional molecules was also studied and relative {SFEs} estimated using energy minimization and thermodynamic cycle perturbation {(TCP)} protocols. {SFEs} calculated from {TCP} calculations using the {GB/SA} model were sensitive to bond lengths of dummy bonds (i.e., bonds involving dummy atoms). In such cases, keeping the bond lengths of dummy bonds close to the corresponding bond lengths of the starting structures improved the agreement of {TCP-calculated} {SFEs} with energy minimization results. Overall, these results indicate that {GB/SA} solvation free energy estimates from simple energy minimization calculations are of similar accuracy and value to those obtained using more elaborate {TCP} protocols. {(C)} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

Recent calculations suggest that changes in configurational entropy strongly oppose binding and must be included if accurate affinities are to be obtained.

Comments on difficulty of convergence and how the single-trajectory approach {(Lee} {BiophysJ} and Brown, Muchmore) helps because protein fluctuations cancel out.

	abstract = {The binding of a series of p-alkylbenzamidinium chloride inhibitors to the serine proteinase trypsin over a range of temperatures has been studied using isothermal titration (micro)calorimetry and molecular dynamics simulation techniques. The inhibitors have small structural variations at the para position of the benzamidinium ion. They show small differences in relative binding affinity but large compensating differences in enthalpy and entropy. Binding affinity decreases with increased branching at the first carbon but increases with increasing the length of a linear alkyl substituent, suggesting that steric hindrance and hydrophobic interactions play dominant roles in binding. Structural analysis showed that the backbone of the enzyme was unaffected by the change of the para substituent. In addition, binding does not correlate strongly with octanol/water partition data. To further characterize this system, the change in the heat capacity on binding, the change in solvent-accessible surface area on binding, the effect of inhibitor binding on the hydration of the active site, the {pK(a)} of His57, and interactions within the catalytic triad have been investigated. Although the changes in inhibitor structure are small, it is demonstrated that simple concepts such as steric hindrance, hydrophobicity, and buried surface area are insufficient to explain the binding data. Other factors, such as access to the binding site and the cost of dehydration of the active site, are of equal or greater importance.},

	abstract = {To overcome the problem of insufficient conformational sampling within biomolecular simulations, we have developed a novel Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics {(H-REMD)} scheme that uses soft-core interactions between those parts of the system that contribute most to high energy barriers. The advantage of this approach over other {H-REMD} schemes is the possibility to use a relatively small number of replicas with locally larger differences between the individual Hamiltonians. Because soft-core potentials are almost the same as regular ones at longer distances, most of the interactions between atoms of perturbed parts will only be slightly changed. Rather, the strong repulsion between atoms that are close in space, which in many cases results in high energy barriers, is weakened within higher replicas of our proposed scheme. In addition to the soft-core interactions, we proposed to include multiple replicas using the same Hamiltonian/level of softness. We have tested the new protocol on the {GTP} and {8-Br-GTP} molecules, which are known to have high energy barriers between the anti and syn conformation of the base with respect to the sugar moiety. During two 25 ns {MD} simulations of both systems the transition from the more stable to the less stable (but still experimentally observed) conformation is not seen at all. Also temperature {REMD} over 50 replicas for 1 ns did not show any transition at room temperature. On the other hand, more than 20 of such transitions are observed in {H-REMD} using six replicas (at three different Hamiltonians) during 6.8 ns per replica for {GTP} and 12 replicas (at six different Hamiltonians) during 8.7 ns per replica for {8-Br-GTP.} The large increase in sampling efficiency was obtained from an optimized {H-REMD} scheme involving soft-core potentials, with multiple simulations using the same level of softness.

The average energy {RMS} deviation from the {LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-f)//HF/6-31G**} data is reduced by ca. 40\% from 0.81 to 0.47 kcal/mol as a result of the fitting for the electrostatically uncharged dipeptides, Transferability of the parameters is demonstrated by using the same alanine dipeptide-fitted backbone torsional parameters for all of the other dipeptides (with the appropriate side-chain refitting) and the alanine tetrapeptide. Parameters of nonbonded interactions have also been refitted for the sulfur-containing dipeptides (cysteine and methionine), and the validity of the new Coulombic charges and the van der Waals sigma 's and epsilon 's is proved through reproducing gas-phase energies of complex formation heats of vaporization and densities of pure model liquids.

The analogy of a jigsaw puzzle, with multiple routes to a unique solution, appears to be particularly apt.},

	abstract = {Understanding the molecular determinants of specificity in proteinâprotein interaction is an outstanding challenge of postgenome biology. The availability of large protein databases generated from sequences of hundreds of bacterial genomes enables various statistical approaches to this problem. In this context covariance-based methods have been used to identify correlation between amino acid positions in interacting proteins. However, these methods have an important shortcoming, in that they cannot distinguish between directly and indirectly correlated residues. We developed a method that combines covariance analysis with global inference analysis, adopted from use in statistical physics. Applied to a set of {\textgreater}2,500 representatives of the bacterial two-component signal transduction system, the combination of covariance with global inference successfully and robustly identified residue pairs that are proximal in space without resorting to ad hoc tuning parameters, both for heterointeractions between sensor kinase {(SK)} and response regulator {(RR)} proteins and for homointeractions between {RR} proteins. The spectacular success of this approach illustrates the effectiveness of the global inference approach in identifying direct interaction based on sequence information alone. We expect this method to be applicable soon to interaction surfaces between proteins present in only 1 copy per genome as the number of sequenced genomes continues to expand. Use of this method could significantly increase the potential targets for therapeutic intervention, shed light on the mechanism of proteinâprotein interaction, and establish the foundation for the accurate prediction of interacting protein partners.},

In this study, computational methods are combined with experimental techniques. Molecular dynamics simulations, resonance Raman and {UV-VIS} spectroscopy, as well as coupling efficiency and substrate-binding experiments, have been performed. The computational findings, supported by the experimental results, enable structural rationalizations of the mutants. The substrates used in this study are known to be metabolized by human cytochrome P450 {2D6.} Interestingly, the major metabolites formed by the P450 {BM3} mutants differ from those formed by human cytochrome P450 {2D6.} The computational findings, supported by resonance Raman data, suggest a conformational change of one of the heme propionate groups. The modeling results furthermore suggest that this conformational change allows for an interaction between the negatively charged carboxylate of the heme substituent and the positively charged nitrogen of the substrates. This allows for an orientation of the substrates favorable for formation of the major metabolite by P450 {BM3.} Proteins 2008. {\textbackslash}copyright 2007 {Wiley-Liss,} Inc.},

The spectral decomposition of the Liouvillian operator is explicitly constructed before, at, and after the Hopf bifurcation. Because of the emergence of time oscillations near the Hopf bifurcation, the resonance spectrum turns out to be complex and defined by both relaxation rates and oscillation frequencies. The resonance spectrum is discrete far from the bifurcation and becomes continuous at the bifurcation. This continuous spectrum is caused by the critical slowing down of the oscillations occurring at the Hopf bifurcation and it leads to power-law relaxation asâroott of the probability densities and statistical averages at long times tâ{\textgreater}infinity.

	volume = {55},
	abstract = {The efficacy of {HIV-1} protease inhibition therapies is often compromised by the appearance of mutations in the protease molecule that lower the binding affinity of inhibitors while maintaining viable catalytic activity and substrate affinity. The {V82F/I84V} double mutation is located within the binding site cavity and affects all protease inhibitors in clinical use. {KNI-764,} a second-generation inhibitor currently under development, maintains significant potency against this mutation by entropically compensating for enthalpic losses, thus minimizing the loss in binding affinity. {KNI-577} differs from {ENI-764} by a single functional group critical to the inhibitor response to the protease mutation. This single difference changes the response of the two inhibitors to the mutation by one order of magnitude. Accordingly, a structural understanding of the inhibitor response will provide important guidelines for the design of inhibitors that are less susceptible to mutations conveying drug resistance. The structures of the two compounds bound to the wild type and {V82F/I84V} {HIV-1} protease have been determined by X-ray crystallography at 2.0 Angstrom resolution. The presence of two asymmetric functional groups, linked by rotatable bonds to the inhibitor scaffold, allows {KNI-764} to adapt to the mutated binding site cavity more readily than {KNI-577,} with a single asymmetric group. Both inhibitors lose about 2.5 kcal/mol in binding enthalpy when facing the drug-resistant mutant protease; however {ENI-764} gains binding entropy while {ENI-577} loses binding entropy. The gain in binding entropy by {ENI-764} accounts for its low susceptibility to the drug-resistant mutation. The heat capacity change associated with binding becomes more negative when {KNI-764} binds to the mutant protease, consistent with increased desolvation. With {KNI-577,} the opposite effect is observed. Structurally, the crystallographic B factors increase for {ENI-764} when it is bound to the drug-resistant mutant. The opposite is observed for {KNI-577.} Consistent with these observations, it appears that {KNI-764} is able to gain. binding entropy by a two-fold mechanism: it gains solvation entropy by burying itself deeper within the binding pocket and gains conformational entropy by losing interaction with the protease. {(C)} 2004 {Wiley-Liss,} Inc.},

Conventional simulations in the canonical ensemble are of little use, because they tend to get trapped in states of these energy local minima. A simulation in generalized ensemble performs a random walk in potential energy space and can overcome this difficulty. From only one simulation run, one can obtain canonical-ensemble averages of physical quantities as functions of temperature by the single-histogram and/or multiple-histogram reweighting techniques. lit this article we review uses of the generalized-ensemble algorithms in biomolecular systems. Three well-known methods, namely, multicanonical algorithm, simulated tempering, and replica-exchange method, are described first. Both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics versions of the algorithms are given. We then present three new generalized-ensemble algorithms that combine the merits of the above methods. The, effectiveness of the methods for molecular simulations in the protein folding problem is tested with short peptide systems. {(C)} 2001 John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

@article{lu_staging_2004,
	title = {Staging is more important than perturbation method for computation of enthalpy and entropy changes in complex systems},
	volume = {107},
	abstract = {ntropy and enthalpy compensation are frequently observed in thermodynamic measurements. To understand the molecular details of these compensating changes, molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo methods may, in principle, be used. Yet, in practice, computational methods to evaluate changes in entropy and enthalpy usually have much greater (e.g. order of magnitude worse) error than relative free energy calculations. In this paper, we examine ways to improve the computational ability to determine changes in both enthalpy and entropy. Toward that end we consider five different perturbation schemes for enthalpy determination and also consider the relative importance of staging the computation (i.e., dividing the entire perturbation calculation into a series of consecutive smaller ones) along the reaction coordinate. Two model systems are used for evaluation: a system of {Lennard-Jones} spheres, where the computation is directed to the addition/deletion of a sphere, and the alchemical transformation of an anion in explicit {TIP3P} water from one type to another. The results show only subtle differences among the better perturbation methods and much larger improvement in relative accuracy with the use and careful selection of staged intermediates along the reaction coordinate. As a result of these calculations, we suggest that approximate calculations of relative entropy be used to guide the staging of intermediates for computation of free energy, entropy, and enthalpy differences. We suggest that for these purposes the single state perturbation {(SSP)} method is the best choice. For the pure purpose of enthalpy and/or entropy evaluation, we suggest multistage {SSP} and direct approach, respectively, for systems with small and large differences.},

Instead, we argue that the best way to proceed is to conduct the {FEP} calculation in one direction, namely that in which the entropy of the target is less than the entropy of the reference. We analyze the behavior of {FEP} calculations in terms of the perturbation-energy distribution functions, and present several routes to characterize the calculations in terms of these distributions.

	abstract = {The complexes of phage T4 lysozyme {L99A} with noble gases have been studied by molecular dynamics simulation. In a long simulation of the complex with one Xe atom, the structure was found to undergo global conformation change involving a reversible opening and closing of the entrance to the substrate-binding site, during which the conformations of the N and C-terminal domains varied little. The distributions of Xe positions sampled in dynamics simulations were refined in terms of anisotropic Gaussian distributions via least-squares minimization of the difference between Fourier transforms. In addition, molecular transformation simulations have been applied in order to calculate the binding free energies of Xe, Kr and Ar relative to a standard state at a pressure of 1 bar. A single bound Xe is found to assume an equilibrium distribution over three adjacent preferred sites, while in a {two-Xe} complex, the two Xe atoms preferentially occupy two of these. The positions of the three sites agree closely with the positions of bound Xe determined in the refined crystal structure of a complex formed at a pressure of 8 bar Xe, and the calculated affinities agree well with the observed partial occupancies. At a pressure of 8 bar, a mixture of {one-Xe} and {two-Xe} complexes is present, and similarly for complexes with Kr and Ar, with single occupancy relatively more prevalent with Kr and Ar. {(Binding} of a third Xe atom is found to be quite unfavorable.) A comparison with simulation results for the binding of benzene to the same site leads to the conclusion that binding of Xe within cavities in proteins is common because of several favorable factors: (1) Xe has a large atomic polarizability; (2) Xe can be applied at a relatively high pressure, i.e. high chemical potential; (3) an unfavorable entropic term related to the need to orient the ligand in the binding site is absent. Finally, it is found that the model's binding energy of a water molecule in the cavity is insufficient to overcome the unfavorable binding entropy.},

Most notably, incorporating more protein flexibility improved the performance of the method. The pharmacophore models successfully discriminate known inhibitors from drug-like non-inhibitors. Furthermore, the models correctly identify the bound conformations of some ligands. We used unliganded {HIV-1} protease to develop and validate this method. Drug design is always initiated with a protein-ligand structure, and such success with unbound protein structures is remarkable - particularly in the case of {HIV-1} protease, which has a large conformational change upon binding. This technique holds the promise of successful computer-based drug design before bound crystal structures are even discovered, which can mean a jump-start of 1-3 years in tackling some medically relevant systems with computational methods.},

The problem of poor statistical accuracy associated with the creation or annihilation of atoms can be treated using a sprouting/desprouting technique, in which it is essential to be able to evaluate constraint contributions to free energy differences. This is illustrated for the mutation of ethanol to ethane in aqueous solution and in vacuo.

	abstract = {The authors present an integrated approach to "alchemical" free energy simulation, which permits efficient calculation of the free energy difference on rugged energy surface. The method is designed to obtain efficient canonical sampling for rapid free energy convergence. The proposal is motivated by the insight that both the exchange efficiency in the presently designed dual-topology alchemical Hamiltonian replica exchange method {(HREM),} and the confidence of the free energy determination using the overlap histogramming method, depend on the same criterion, viz., the overlaps of the energy difference histograms between all pairs of neighboring states. Hence, integrating these two techniques can produce a joint solution to the problems of the free energy convergence and conformational sampling in the free energy simulations, in which \${\textbackslash}lambda\$ parameter plays two roles to simultaneously facilitate the conformational sampling and improve the phase space overlap for the free energy determination. Specifically, in contrast with other alchemical {HREM} based free energy simulation methods, the dual-topology approach can ensure robust conformational sampling. Due to these features (a synergistic solution to the free energy convergence and canonical sampling, and the improvement of the sampling efficiency with the dual-topology treatment), the present approach, as demonstrated in the model studies of the authors, is highly efficient in obtaining accurate free energy differences, especially for the systems with rough energy landscapes.},

	abstract = {The ff94 force field that is commonly associated with the Amber simulation package is one of the most widely used parameter sets for biomolecular simulation. After a decade of extensive use and testing, limitations in this force field, such as over-stabilization of \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-helices, were reported by us and other researchers. This led to a number of attempts to improve these parameters, resulting in a variety of Amber force fields and significant difficulty in determining which should be used for a particular application. We show that several of these continue to suffer from inadequate balance between different secondary structure elements. In addition, the approach used in most of these studies neglected to account for the existence in Amber of two sets of backbone \${\textbackslash}phi\$/\${\textbackslash}psi\$ dihedral terms. This led to parameter sets that provide unreasonable conformational preferences for glycine. We report here an effort to improve the \${\textbackslash}phi\$/\${\textbackslash}psi\$ dihedral terms in the ff99 energy function. Dihedral term parameters are based on fitting the energies of multiple conformations of glycine and alanine tetrapeptides from high level ab initio quantum mechanical calculations. The new parameters for backbone dihedrals replace those in the existing ff99 force field. This parameter set, which we denote {ff99SB,} achieves a better balance of secondary structure elements as judged by improved distribution of backbone dihedrals for glycine and alanine with respect to {PDB} survey data. It also accomplishes improved agreement with published experimental data for conformational preferences of short alanine peptides and better accord with experimental {NMR} relaxation data of test protein systems.},

	abstract = {A new generalization of the configurational-bias Monte Carlo method is presented which avoids the problems inherent in a Boltzmann rejection scheme for sequentially generating bond bending and torsional angles. The {TraPPE-UA} (transferable potentials for phase equilibria united-atom) force field is extended to include {Lennard-Jones} interaction parameters for methine and quaternary carbon groups by fitting to critical temperatures and saturated liquid densities of branched alkanes. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs ensemble were carried out to determine the vapor-liquid coexistence curves {(VLCC)} for six alkane isomers with four to eight carbons. Results are presented for two united-atom alkane force fields: {PRF} {[Poncela,} et al. Mel. Phys. 1997, 91, 189] and {TraFPE-UA,} Standard-state specific densities for the {TraPPE-UA} model were studied by simulations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble. It is found that a single set of methyl, methylene, methine, and quaternary carbon parameters gives a reasonable description of the fluid phases of all alkanes with two or more carbon atoms. Whereas the size of the united atoms increases with increasing number of hydrogens for the {PRF} force field, it is demonstrated here that the opposite trend yields a better fit to the experimental {VLCC} data. The {TraPPE-UA} force field underpredicts the magnitude of the experimental second virial coefficients, while {PRF} gives good second virial coefficients but does not perform satisfactorily for the {VLCC.} As is also seen for the normal alkanes, the {TraPPE-UA} force field shows small, systematic deviations from the experimental saturated vapor pressures and densities for all molecules studied, and it slightly overpredicts the critical temperatures of the larger branched alkanes.},

The models exhibit the asymmetry that is sometimes seen in these calculations, in which the magnitude of the bias is greater when the calculation is performed in one direction {(A-{\textgreater}B,} sampling system A and perturbing into system B) versus the other {(B-{\textgreater}A),} Both models are formulated as a system of N independent particles, each sampling a space in the presence of a one-body field that is different for the A and B systems. In one model the field is a harmonic potential. The other model is discrete, such that each particle can be at one of two points (or states) of different energy. The neglected-tail bias model is applied to each system to estimate the average bias as a function of the amount of {FEP} sampling, and numerical calculations are performed to show that the bias model is effective. We show that the bias is significantly smaller when sampling is performed on the system having a broader work distribution (we designate this direction âinsertionâ ) compared to the bias for {FEP} calculations that sample the system with a narrower distribution (âdeletionâ)},

	volume = {48},
	abstract = {The recently described molecular mechanics {Poisson-Boltzmann} surface area {(MM-PBSA)} method for calculating free energies is applied to a congeneric series of 16 ligands to p38 {MAP} kinase whose binding constants span approximately 2 orders of magnitude. These compounds have previously been used to test and compare other free energy calculation methods, including thermodynamic integration {(TI),} {OWFEG,} {ChemScore,} {PLPScore,} and Dock Energy Score. We find that the {MM-PBSA} performs relatively poorly for this set of ligands, yielding results much inferior to those from {TI} or {OWFEG,} inferior to Dock Energy Score, and not appreciably better than {ChemScore} or {PLPScore} but at an appreciably larger computational cost than any of these other methods. This suggests that one should be selective in applying the {MM-PBSA} method and that for systems that are amenable to other free energy approaches, these other approaches may be preferred. We also examine the single simulation approximation for {MM-} {PBSA,} whereby the required ligand and protein trajectories are extracted from a single {MD} simulation rather than two separate {MD} runs. This assumption, sometimes used to speed the {MM-PBSA} calculation, is found to yield significantly inferior results with only a moderate net percentage reduction in total simulation time.},

The new algorithm termed mode integration {(MINTA)} was applied here to explain anharmonic effects in cycloheptane and to predict the A value of cyclohexane derivatives and the anomeric free energy of carbohydrates (tetrahydropyran derivatives and pyranose monosaccharides) using a continuum solvation model.},

	abstract = {The current status of docking procedures for predicting protein-protein interactions starting from their three-dimensional {(3D)} structure is reassessed by evaluating blind predictions, performed during 2003-2004 as part of Rounds 3-5 of the community-wide experiment on Critical Assessment of {PRedicted} Interactions {(CAPRI).} Ten newly determined structures of protein-protein complexes were used as targets for these rounds. They comprised 2 enzyme-inhibitor complexes, 2 antigen-antibody complexes, 2 complexes involved in cellular signaling, 2 homo-oligomers, and a complex between 2 components of the bacterial cellulosome. For most targets, the predictors were given the experimental structures of 1 unbound and 1 bound component, with the latter in a random orientation. For some, the structure of the free component was derived from that of a related protein, requiring the use of homology modeling. In some of the targets, significant differences in conformation were displayed between the bound and unbound components, representing a major challenge for the docking procedures. For 1 target, predictions could not go to completion. In total, 1866 predictions submitted by 30 groups were evaluated. Over one-third of these groups applied completely novel docking algorithms and scoring functions, with several of them specifically addressing the challenge of dealing with side-chain and backbone flexibility. The quality of the predicted interactions was evaluated by comparison to the experimental structures of the targets, made available for the evaluation, using the well-agreed-upon criteria used previously. Twenty-four groups, which for the first time included an automatic Web server, produced predictions ranking from acceptable to highly accurate for all targets, including those where the structures of the bound and unbound forms differed substantially. These results and a brief survey of the methods used by participants of {CAPRI} Rounds 3-5 suggest that genuine progress in the performance of docking methods is being achieved, with {CAPRI} acting as the catalyst.},

The different force field terms used in molecular simulations can be constrained or softened leading to a maximum time step of 5 fs for a simulation, in which static equilibrium properties are not affected by the changes in the force field parameters introduced, but dynamical quantities are. Using a very smoothed, soft interaction function and increased hydrogen masses, a time step of 14 fs can be reached. However, it should only be used in refinement simulations, in which the unphysical properties of the force field and dynamics are of minor importance.},

The designed compounds were also monitored for possession of desirable pharmacological properties by use of additional computational tools. Overall, the trends predicted by the {FEP} calculations were well borne out by the assay results. {FEP-guided} lead optimization is confirmed as a valuable tool for molecular design including drug discovery; chlorine scans are particularly attractive since they are both straightforward to perform and highly informative.},

	abstract = {The {HA} of influenza virus is a receptor-binding and fusion protein that is required to initiate infection. The {HA} receptor-binding domain determines the species of sialyl receptors recognized by influenza viruses. Here, we demonstrate that changes in the {HA} receptor-binding domain alter the ability of the {H5N1} virus to spread systemically in mice. The {A/Vietnam/1203/04} {(VN1203)} and {A/Hong} Kong/213/03 {(HK213)} viruses are consistently lethal to domestic chickens but differ in their pathogenicity to mammals. Insertion of the {VN1203} {HA} and neuraminidase {(NA)} genes into recombinant {HK213} virus expanded its tissue tropism and increased its lethality in mice; conversely, insertion of {HK213} {HA} and {NA} genes into recombinant {VN1203} virus decreased its systemic spread and lethality. The {VN1203} and {HK213} {HAs} differ by 10 aa, and {HK213} {HA} has shown greater binding affinity for synthetic Î±2,6-linked sialyl receptor. Introduction of an {S227N} change and removal of -linked glycosylation at residue 158 increased the Î±2,6-binding affinity of {VN1203} {HA.} Recombinant {VN1203} virus carrying the {S227N} change alone or with the residue-158 glycosylation site removed showed reduced lethality and systemic spread in mice but not in domestic chickens. Wild-type {VN1203} virus exhibited the greatest efficiency in systemic spread after intramuscular inoculation and in infection of mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells and conventional pulmonary dendritic cells. These results show that {VN1203} {HA} glycoprotein confers pathogenicity by facilitating systemic spread in mice; they also suggest that a minor change in receptor binding domain may modulate the virulence of {H5N1} viruses.},

	abstract = {A new method for refining three-dimensional {(3D)} {NMR} structures of proteins is described, which takes account of the complete relaxation pathways. Derivatives of the {NOE} intensities with respect to the dihedral angles are analytically calculated, and efficiently evaluated with the use of a filter technique for identifying the dominant terms of these derivatives. This new method was implemented in the distance geometry pro- gram {DIANA.} As an initial test, we refined 30 rigid distorted helical structures, using a simulated data set of {NOE} distance constraints for a rigid standard or-helix. The final root-mean-square deviations of the refined structures relative to the standard helix were less than 0. I A, and the R-factors dropped from values between 7\% and 32\% to values of less than 0.5\% in all cases, which compares favorably with the results from distance geometry calculations. In particular, because spin diffusion was not explicitly considered in the evaluation of 'exact' t H H distances corresponding to the simulated {NOE} intensities, a group of nearly identical distance geometry structures was obtained which had about 0.5/ root-mean-square deviation from the standard t- helix. Further test calculations using an experimental {NOE} data set recorded for the protein trypsin inhibitor K showed that the complete relaxation matrix refinement procedure in the {DIANA} program is functional also with systems of practical interest.},

	abstract = {Current methods for predicting protein structure depend on two interrelated components: () an energy function that should have a low value near the correct structure and () a method for searching through different conformations of the polypeptide chain. Identification of the most efficient search methods is essential if we are to be able to apply such methods broadly and with confidence. In addition, efficient search methods provide a rigorous test of existing energy functions, which are generally knowledge-based and contain different terms added together with arbitrary weights. Here, we test different search methods with one of the most accurate and predictive energy functions, namely Rosetta the knowledge-based force-field from Baker's group {[Simons} K, Kooperberg C, Huang E, Baker D (1997) 268:209â225]. We use an implementation of a generalized ensemble search method to scale relevant parts of the energy function. This method, known as Hamiltonian Replica Exchange Monte Carlo, outperforms the original Monte Carlo Simulated Annealing used in the Rosetta package in terms of sampling low-energy states. It also outperforms another widely used generalized ensemble search method known as Temperature Replica Exchange Monte Carlo. Our results reveal clear deficiencies in the low-resolution Rosetta energy function in that the lowest energy structures are not necessarily the most native-like. By using a set of nonnative low-energy structures found by our extensive sampling, we discovered that the long-range and short-range backbone hydrogen-bonding energy terms of the Rosetta energy discriminate between the nonnative and native-like structures significantly better than the low-resolution score used in Rosetta.},

	abstract = {The transferable potentials for phase equilibria-united atom {(TraPPE-UA)} force field for hydrocarbons is extended to primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols by introducing the following (pseudo-)atoms: common hydroxyl O and H for all alcohols, alpha {-CH3,} alpha {-CH2,} alpha {-CH,} and alpha {-C} for methanol, primary, secondary, and tertiary alcohols, respectively. In the {TraPPE-UA} force field, the nonbonded interactions of these sites are governed by {Lennard-Jones} 12-6 potentials and Coulombic interactions of fixed partial charges. The values of these partial charges were borrowed from the optimized potentials for liquid simulations-united atom {(OPLS-UA)} force field {[Jorgensen,} W. L. J. Phys. Chern. 1986, 90, 1276]. The {Lennard-Jones} well depth and size parameters for the new interaction sites were determined by fitting to the single-component vapor-liquid-phase equilibria of a few selected model compounds. Although the well-depth parameters for the alpha -carbons could be taken directly from the {TraPPE-UA} parameters for the corresponding pseudoatoms in alkanes, the size parameters required small adjustments to reflect the differences in {C-C} and {C-O} bond lengths and the reduced electron density for alpha -carbons. Coupled-decoupled configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs and grand-canonical ensembles were carried out to calculate the one-component vapor-liquid coexistence curves for methanol, ethanol, propan-1-ol, propan-2-ol, butan-2-ol, 2-methylpropan-2-ol, pentan-1-ol, pentane-1,5-diol, and octan-1-ol, and to determine the binary phase diagrams for the mixtures of n-hexane/methanol and n-hexane/ethanol. It was found that the phase equilibria of the pure alcohols are accurately described by the {TraPPE-UA} force field, with mean unsigned deviations of about 1\% from the experimental},

	abstract = {Human serum albumin {(HSA)} has seven common fatty acid {(FA)} binding sites. In this study, we used the molecular mechanics {Poisson-Boltzmann} surface area method to identify high affinity {FA} binding sites on {HSA} in terms of binding free energy. Using multiple {HSA-FA} (myristate, palmitate) complex models constructed by molecular dynamics simulations, two methods were performed in molecular mechanics {Poisson-Boltzmann} surface area, the "three-trajectory method" and the "single-trajectory method". The former, which is less precise than the latter but may be more accurate as it includes the effects of conformational change upon binding, was used to classify high and low affinity sites. As a result, Sites 2, 4, and 5 were identified as high affinity sites for both {FAs.} The latter method, which is precise because energies are calculated from snapshots of the same trajectory for {HSA-FA} complex, was performed to compare the magnitude of binding free energy for these sites. The order of magnitude was 5 {\textgreater} 4 {\textgreater} 2, identical to that of a previous publication by others. In this way, a combination of the two methods was effectively used to identify high affinity sites. This study therefore provides an insight into the quantitative identification of high affinity {FA} binding sites on {HSA.}},

This allows the fragments to sample various low-energy orientations. When the geometry between proximal fragments is appropriate, bonds can be formed between the fragments. In this fashion, larger molecules can be built. The bonding arrangement can subsequently be changed-breaking bonds between chosen fragment pairs and forming them between other pairs-if the overall process creates lower energy molecules. We have tested this method with various mixes of fragments against the active sites of the {FK506} binding protein {(FKBP-12)} and {HIV-1} aspartyl protease.

By analyzing the Ising model we are able to determine the scaling behavior of the numerical error in the pfold estimate as function of the number of analyzed Monte Carlo runs. We apply our method to a simple, newly developed protein folding model for the formation of alpha helices.

In common water models, the {Lennard-Jones} center is closer to the negatively charged oxygen than to the positively charged hydrogens. This asymmetry of water's charge sites leads to different hydration free energies of positive versus negative ions of the same size. Here, we explore these hydration effects for some hypothetical neutral solutes, and two real solutes, with molecular dynamics simulations using several different water models. We find that, like ions, polar solutes are solvated differently in water depending on the sign of the partial charges. Solutes having a large negative charge balancing diffuse positive charges are preferentially solvated relative to those having a large positive charge balancing diffuse negative charges. Asymmetries in hydration free energies can be as large as 10 kcal/mol for neutral benzene-sized solutes. These asymmetries are mainly enthalpic, arising primarily from the first solvation shell water structure. Such effects are not readily captured by implicit solvent models, which respond symmetrically with respect to charge.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Fatty acid amide hydrolase {(FAAH)} is a serine hydrolase responsible for the degradation of anandamide, an endogenous cannabinoid agonist, and oleamide, a sleep-inducing lipid. Recently, Boger and co-workers reported a potent, selective, and efficacious class of reversible -ketoheterocycle inhibitors of {FAAH} that produce analgesia in animal models {(J.} Med. Chem. 2005, 48, 1849-1856; Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 2005, 15, 1423-1428). Key aspects of the structure-activity data are addressed here through computational analysis of {FAAH} inhibition using Monte Carlo {(MC)} simulations in conjunction with free energy perturbation {(FEP)} calculations. The {MC/FEP} simulations demonstrate that incorporation of pyridine at the C5 position of the 2-keto-oxazole and 2-keto-1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives significantly enhances binding affinity by formation of a hydrogen-bonded array between the pyridyl nitrogen and Lys142 and Thr236. The results also attribute the activity boost upon substitution of oxazole by oxadiazole to reduced steric interactions in the active site and a lower torsional energy penalty upon binding.},

These calculations require hours to a day on a commodity computer. The calculations also indicate that the changes in configurational entropy upon binding oppose association by as much as 24 kcal/mol and result primarily from a narrowing of energy wells in the bound versus the free state, rather than from a drop in the number of distinct low-energy conformations on binding. Also, the configurational entropy is found to vary substantially among the bound conformations of a given cyclodextrin-guest complex. This result suggests that the configurational entropy must be accounted for to reliably rank docked conformations in both host-guest and ligand-protein complexes. In close analogy with the common experimental observation of entropy-enthalpy compensation, the computed entropy changes show a near-linear relationship with the changes in mean potential plus solvation energy},

We have investigated these contributions to the solvation free energy of small hydrophobic solutes and studied the dependence of the entropy cost of solute insertion on solvent-solvent interactions in cosolvent/water mixtures by means of molecular dynamics simulations. The cosolvents acetone, dimethyl sulfoxide, and sodium chloride were studied. Acetone, which weakly interacts with water relative to hydrogen-bonding interactions in neat water, preferentially binds to hydrophobic solutes thereby raising their solubility. We find that this process is driven by a reduced entropic expense of opening up molecular-sized cavities close to the acetone methyl moieties. Sodium chloride and dimethyl sulfoxide are strongly hydrated, causing entropy to oppose hydrophobic solute insertion even stronger than it does in neat water. In sodium chloride/water the solute is preferentially âwettedâ causing it to be âsalted-outâ. Dimethyl sulfoxide methyl moieties bind to the hydrophobic solute. This process, occurring at the expense of entropy, is driven by a favorable solute-solvent energy and causes âsalting-inâ of the hydrophobic solute.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Estrogen receptor {(ER)} and {(ER)} are ligand activated transcription factors that have different physiological functions and differential expression in certain tissues. The ligand binding domain of {ER} shares 58\% sequence identity with that of {ER.} However, in the binding pocket there are only two relative residue substitutions. This high similarity at the active site is a great challenge for designing selective estrogen receptor modulators. {ER} is shown to be related to several diseases. To understand the molecular basis of {ER} selectivity, molecular dynamics simulations were carried out for both {ER} and {ER} complexes. Our simulations revealed the conformational changes at the active site of the {ERs} and the difference of affinity with ligand. The electrostatic repulsion between the S atom of {ER} Met421 and the acetonitrile group nitrogen atom of the ligand led to unfavorable binding. The repulsion resulted in the conformational change of the side chain of {ER} Met421, which changed the conformation of both Leu346 and Phe425. These residues changes expanded the volume of binding cavity, which led to unstable binding of the ligand. In addition, {ER} Met336 formed more hydrophobic contacts with the ligand relative to corresponding residue {ER} Leu384. Furthermore, the binding free energy analysis was shown to be correlated with the previous results determined by experiment. At last, free energy decomposition evidently indicated the contributions of key residues. The present results could help explain the mechanism of {ER} selectivity and may be considered in the design of subtype-selective ligands.},

	volume = {113},
	abstract = {A novel Monte Carlo technique, the rebridging configurational-bias {(RCB)} method, has been developed to rearrange inner sections of chain molecules having strong intramolecular interactions along the backbone. The ability of sampling inner chain segments is important for the simulation of systems with low concentration of chain ends, such as polymers and molecules with cyclic structures. In the {RCB} method, inner segments are removed and then regrown site-by-site in a configurational-bias fashion. However, a short preliminary simulation is carried out to calculate weighting functions based on histograms of the separation distance between pairs of sites along the chain; these functions are used to bias the trial positions of growing inner sites so as to promote efficient chain closure. A look-ahead search scheme is employed for the sampling of the last two sites to increase the overall acceptance rate of the reconstruction process. The validity and performance of the new algorithm were tested by studying linear alkane systems of various chain lengths. Fast conformational equilibration was observed, from the level of local bond orientations to the level of the chain end-to-end vector orientations. Cyclic alkanes containing from 8 to 100 carbon atoms were also studied by using the {RCB} method. Our results for the conformational properties of cyclooctane are generally consistent with previous molecular dynamics {(MD)} results and with experimental data. The vapor-liquid coexistence curve of cyclooctane was also mapped out by using the {RCB} method in conjunction with a histogram reweighting technique for the analysis of isothermal-isobaric simulations. {(C)} 2000 American Institute of Physics. {[S0021-9606(00)51848-0].}},

We have simulated a total of nearly 38 mus of, folding time and obtained eight complete and independent folding trajectories. Starting from an extended state, we observe relaxation to an unfolded state characterized by non-specific, temporary hydrogen bonding. This is followed by the appearance of interactions between hydrophobic residues that stabilize a bent intermediate. Final formation of the complete hydrophobic core occurs cooperatively at the same time that the final hydrogen bonding pattern appears. The folded hairpin structures we observe all contain a closely packed hydrophobic core and proper beta -sheet backbone dihedral angles, but they differ in backbone hydrogen bonding pattern. We show that this is consistent with the existing experimental data on the hairpin alone in solution. Our analysis also reveals short-lived semi-helical intermediates which define a thermodynamic trap. Our results are consistent with a three-state mechanism with a single rate-limiting step in which a varying final hydrogen bond pattern is apparent, and senmi-helical off-pathway intermediates may appear early in the folding process.

The binding free energies were computed from the difference between the free energies of decoupling the ligand from water and protein environments. Both the absolute and the relative free energies from the perturbation simulations agree with experimental measurements to within 0.5 kcal mol-1. Comparison of free energy components sampled from different thermodynamic paths indicates that electrostatics is the main driving force behind benzamidine recognition of trypsin. The contribution of electronic polarization to binding appears to be crucial. By computing the free energy contribution due to the polarization between the ligand and its surroundings, we found that polarization has the opposite effect in dissimilar environments. While polarization favors ligand solvation in water, it weakens the protein-ligand attraction by screening the electrostatic interaction between trypsin and benzamidine. We also examined the relative binding free energies of a benzamidine analog diazamidine to trypsin. The changes in free energy upon benzamidine-diazamidine substitution were tens of kilocalories in both water and trypsin environments; however, the change in the total binding free energy is less than 2 kcal mol-1 due to cancellation, consistent with the experimental results. Overall, our results suggest that the use of a polarizable force field, given adequate sampling, is capable of achieving chemical accuracy in molecular simulations of protein-ligand recognition.},

	copyright = {(c)2004 Institute for Scientific Information, Inc.},
	abstract = {Computational studies of proteins based on empirical force fields represent a powerful tool to obtain structure-function relationships at an atomic level, and are central in current efforts to solve the protein folding problem. The results from studies applying these tools are, however, dependent on the quality of the force fields used. In particular, accurate treatment of the peptide backbone is crucial to achieve representative conformational distributions in simulation studies. To improve the treatment of the peptide backbone, quantum mechanical {(QM)} and molecular mechanical {(MM)} calculations were undertaken on the alanine, glycine, and proline dipeptides, and the results from these calculations were combined with molecular dynamics {(MD)} simulations of proteins in crystal and aqueous environments. {QM} potential energy maps of the alanine and glycine dipeptides at the {LMP2/cc-pVxZ//MP2/6-31G*} levels, where x = D, T, and Q, were determined, and are compared to available {QM} studies on these molecules. The {LMP2/ce-pVQZ//MP2/6-31G*} energy surfaces for all three dipeptides were then used to improve the {MM} treatment of the dipeptides. These improvements included additional parameter optimization via Monte Carlo simulated annealing and extension of the potential energy function to contain peptide backbone phi, psi dihedral crossterms or a phi, psi grid-based energy correction term. Simultaneously, {MD} simulations of up to seven proteins in their crystalline environments were used to validate the force field enhancements. Comparison with {QM} and crystallographic data showed that an additional optimization of the phi, psi dihedral parameters along with the grid-based energy correction were required to yield significant improvements over the {CHARMM22} force field. However, systematic deviations in the treatment of phi and psi in the helical and sheet regions were evident. Accordingly, empirical adjustments were made to the grid-based energy correction for alanine and glycine to account for these systematic differences. These adjustments lead to greater deviations from {QM} data for the two dipeptides but also yielded improved agreement. with experimental crystallographic data. These improvements enhance the quality of the {CHARMM} force field in treating proteins. This extension of the potential energy function is anticipated to facilitate improved treatment of biological macromolecules via {MM} approaches in general. {(C)} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Free energy calculations for the transfer of a water molecule from the pure liquid to an interior cavity site in a protein are presented. Two different protein cavities, in bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor {(BPTI)} and in the {I76A} mutant of barnase, represent very different environments for the water molecule: one which is polar, forming four water-protein hydrogen bonds, and one which is more hydrophobic, forming only one water-protein hydrogen bond. The calculations give very different free energies for the different cavities, with only the polar {BPTI} cavity predicted to be hydrated. The corresponding entropies for the transfer to the interior cavities are calculated as well and show that the transfer to the polar cavity is significantly entropically unfavorable while the transfer to the nonpolar cavity is entropically favorable. For both proteins an analysis of the fluctuations in the positions of the protein atoms shows that the addition of a water molecule makes the protein more flexible. This increased flexibility appears to be due to an increased length and weakened strength of protein-protein hydrogen bonds near the cavity.},

Our dynamical simulations of ligand-receptor complexes underscore the highly structured nature of the complex and offer some interesting insights into the structure-activity relationship {(SAR)} for these ligands. With traditional thermodynamic integration {(TI)} calculations, we calculate relative binding free energies for three known agonists, in good agreement with experimental values. The sheer number of possible xenoestrogenic compounds makes an approach using traditional free energy calculations unfeasible. Instead, we have made use of a single-step perturbation methodology that allows the calculation of relative free energies for a large number of related polyaromatic hydrocarbons {(PAHs)} from a single simulation. Our results show good (maximum deviation 3.3 {kJ} mol-1) agreement with experimental data, suggesting the possibility of large-scale xenoestrogen screening in silico to obtain strongly estrogenic compounds for subsequent experimental testing.},

	volume = {110},
	abstract = {The use of Ewald and related methods to handle electrostatic interactions in explicit-solvent simulations of solutions imposes an artificial periodicity on systems which are inherently nonperiodic. The consequences of this approximation should be assessed, since they may crucially affect the reliability of those computer simulations. In the present study, we propose a general method based on continuum electrostatics to investigate the nature and magnitude of periodicity-induced artifacts. As a first example, this scheme is applied to the solvation free-energy of a spherical ion. It is found that artificial periodicity reduces the magnitude of the ionic solvation free-energy, because the solvent in the periodic copies of the central unit cell is perturbed by the periodic copies of the ion, thus less available to solvate the central ion. In the limit of zero ionic radius and infinite solvent permittivity, this undersolvation can be corrected by adding the Wigner self-energy term to the solvation free-energy. For ions of a finite size or a solvent of finite permittivity, a further correction is needed. An analytical expression for this correction is derived using continuum electrostatics. As a second example, the effect of artificial periodicity on the potential of mean force for the interaction between two spherical ions is investigated. It is found that artificial periodicity results in an attractive force between ions of like charges, and a repulsive force between ions of opposite charges. The analysis of these two simple test cases reveals that two individually large terms, the periodicity-induced perturbations of the Coulomb and solvation contributions, often cancel each other significantly, resulting in an overall small perturbation. Three factors may prevent this cancellation to occur and enhance the magnitude of periodicity-induced artifacts: (i) a solvent of low dielectric permittivity, (ii) a solute cavity of non-negligible size compared to the unit cell size, and (iii) a solute bearing a large overall charge. {(C)} 1999 American Institute of Physics. {[S0021-9606(99)50104-9].}},

Excellent agreement with experimental results was found, with the mean unsigned errors being less than 1\% for both the critical temperature and the normal boiling temperature. Similarly, the liquid densities at low reduced temperatures are reproduced to within 1\%, and the deviation for the critical densities is about 4\%. Additional simulations were performed for the binary mixtures of methylamine + n-hexane, diethyl ether + acetonitrile, 1-propanol + acetonitrile, and nitroethane + ethanol. With the exception of the methylamine/n-hexane mixture for which the separation factor is substantially overestimated, agreement with experiment for the other three mixtures is very satisfactory.},

	abstract = {In type 2 diabetes, the liver produces excessive amounts of glucose through the gluconeogenesis {(GNG)} pathway and consequently is partly responsible for the elevated glucose levels characteristic of the disease. In an effort to find safe and efficacious {GNG} inhibitors, we targeted the {AMP} binding site of fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase {(FBPase).} The hydrophilic nature of {AMP} binding sites and their widespread use for allosteric regulation of enzymes in metabolic pathways has historically made discovery of {AMP} mimetics suitable for drug development difficult. By using a structure-based drug design strategy, we discovered a series of compounds that mimic {AMP} but bear little structural resemblance. The lead compound, {MB05032,} exhibited high potency and specificity for human {FBPase.} Oral delivery of {MB05032} was achieved by using the bisamidate prodrug {MB06322} {(CS-917),} which is converted to {MB05032} in two steps through the action of an esterase and a phosphoramidase. {MB06322} inhibited glucose production from a variety of {GNG} substrates in rat hepatocytes and from bicarbonate in male Zucker diabetic fatty rats. Analysis of liver {GNG} pathway intermediates confirmed {FBPase} as the site of action. Oral administration of {MB06322} to Zucker diabetic fatty rats led to a dose-dependent decrease in plasma glucose levels independent of insulin levels and nutritional status. Glucose lowering occurred without signs of hypoglycemia or significant elevations in plasma lactate or triglyceride levels. The findings suggest that potent and specific {FBPase} inhibitors represent a drug class with potential to treat type 2 diabetes through inhibition of {GNG.} 10.1073/pnas.0502983102},

	abstract = {Free energy calculations are increasingly being used to estimate absolute and relative binding free energies of ligands to proteins. However, computed free energies often appear to depend on the initial protein conformation, indicating incomplete sampling. This is especially true when proteins can change conformation on ligand binding, as free energies associated with these conformational changes are either ignored or assumed to be included by virtue of the sampling performed in the calculation. Here, we show that, in a model protein system (a designed binding site in T4 lysozyme), conformational changes can make a difference of several kcal/mol in computed binding free energies and that they are neglected in computed binding free energies if the system remains kinetically trapped in a particular metastable state on simulation timescales. We introduce a general "confine-and-release" framework for free energy calculations that accounts for these free energies of conformational change. We illustrate its use in this model system by demonstrating that an umbrella sampling protocol can obtain converged binding free energies that are independent of the starting protein structure and include these conformational change free energies.},

	abstract = {Precise thermodynamic integration free energy simulations have been applied to a congeneric series of 16 inhibitors to the p38 {MAP} kinase protein for which the experimental binding data {(IC50)} is known. The relative free energy of binding for each compound has been determined. For comparison, the same series of compounds have also scored using the best rapid scoring functions used in database screening. From the results of these calculations, we find (1) that precise free energy simulations allow predictions that are reliable and in good agreement with experiment; (2) that predictions of lower reliability, but still in good qualitative agreement with experiment, can be obtained using the {OWFEG} free energy grid method, at a much lower computational cost; (3) and that other methods, not based on free energy simulations yield results in much poorer agreement with experiment. A new predictive index, which measures the reliability of a prediction method in the context of normal use, is defined and calculated for each scoring method. Predictive indices of 0.84, 0.56, 0.04, -0.05, and 0.25 are calculated for thermodynamic integration, {OWFEG,} {ChemScore,} {PLPScore,} and Dock Energy Score, respectively, where +1.0 is perfect correct prediction, -1.0 is perfect incorrect prediction, and 0.0 is random.},

Delta G(hydr) values were calculated by multiconfiguration thermodynamic integration for each of the different force fields with three different sets of partial atomic charges: full charges from an electrostatic potential fit {(ESP),} and {ESP} charges scaled by 0.8 and 0.6. All force fields, except for {GROMOS87,} give reasonable results for Delta G(hydr) if partial atomic charges of appropriate magnitude are assigned. For {GROMOS87,} the agreement with experiment for hydrocarbons (propane and ethane) was improved considerably by modifying the repulsive part of the carbon-water oxygen {Lennard-Jones} potential. The small molecules studied are related to the chemical moieties constituting camphor {(C10H16O).} By invoking force-field transferability, we calculated the Delta G(hydr) for camphor. With the modified {GROMOS} force field, a Delta G(hydr) within 4 {kJ/mol} of the experimental value of - 14.8 {kJ/mol} was obtained. Camphor is one of the largest molecules for which an absolute hydration free energy has been calculated by molecular simulation. The accuracy and reliability of the thermodynamic integration calculations were analyzed in detail and we found that, for Delta G(hydr) calculations for the set of small molecules in aqueous solution, molecular dynamics simulations of 0.8-1.0 ns in length give an upper statistical error bound of 1.5 {kJ/mol,} whereas shorter simulations of 0.25 nm in length given an upper statistical error bound of 3.5 {kJ/mol.} {(C)} 1997 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

We investigate convergence, internal consistency, and model dependency of {MM/PBSA} ligand binding energies. Converged enthalpy and entropy estimates produce ligand binding affinities within 1.5 kcal/mol of experimental values, with a remarkable level of correlation to the experimentally observed ranking of resistance levels. A detailed analysis of the enthalpic/entropic balance of drug-protease interactions explains resistance in {L90M} in terms of a higher vibrational entropy than in the {WT} complex, while {G48V} disrupts critical hydrogen bonds at the inhibitor's binding site and produces an altered, more unfavorable balance of Coulomb and polar desolvation energies.},

In many instances it is, however, desirable to describe key portions of a molecular system at the atomic level. There is therefore a strong interest in the development of simulation methodologies that allow representations of matter with mixed granularities in a multiscale fashion. We report here a strategy to conduct mixed atomic-level and coarse-grain simulations of molecular systems with a recently developed coarse-grain model. The methodology is validated by computing partition coefficients of small molecules described in atomic detail and solvated by water or octane, both of which are represented by coarse-grain models. Because the present coarse-grain force field retains electrostatic interactions, the simplified solvent particles can interact realistically with the all-atom solutes. The partition coefficients computed by this approach rival the accuracy of fully atomistic simulations and are obtained at a fraction of their computational cost. The present methodology is simple, robust and applicable to a wide variety of molecular systems.},

The F1 subcomplex has three catalytic nucleotide binding sites, one on each [beta] subunit, with widely differing affinities for {MgATP} or {MgADP.} During rotational catalysis, the sites switch their affinities. The affinity of each site is determined by the position of the central gamma subunit. The site with the highest nucleotide binding affinity is catalytically active. From the available x-ray structures, it is not possible to discern the high-affinity site. Using fluorescence resonance energy transfer between tryptophan residues engineered into gamma and trinitrophenyl nucleotide analogs on the catalytic sites, we were able to determine that the high-affinity site is close to the C-terminal helix of gamma, but at considerable distance from its N terminus. Thus, the {[beta]TP} site in the x-ray structure {[Abrahams} {JP,} Leslie {AGW,} Lutter R, Walker {JE} (1994) Nature 370:621628] is the high-affinity site, in agreement with the prediction of Yang et al. {[Yang} W, Gao {YQ,} Cui Q, Ma J, Karplus M (2003) Proc Natl Acad Sci {USA} 100:874879].

Choices are considered in which w(u)=1 {andâcosh[(u-C)/2];} the latter being Bennett's method where C is a parameter that can be selected arbitrarily, and may be used to optimize the precision of the calculation. We examine the methods in several applications: calculation of the pressure of a square-well fluid by perturbing the volume, the chemical potential of a high-density {Lennard-Jones} system, and the chemical potential of a model for water. We find that the approaches based on Bennett's method weighting are very effective at ensuring an accurate result (one in which the systematic error arising from inadequate sampling is less than the estimated confidence limits), and that even the selection w(u)=1 offers marked improvement over comparable methods. We suggest that Bennett's method is underappreciated, and the benefits it offers for improved precision and (especially) accuracy are substantial, and therefore it should be more widely used. {(C)} 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {Abstract: We present a binding free energy function that consists of force field terms supplemented by solvation terms. We used this function to calibrate the solvation model along with the binding interaction terms in a self-consistent manner. The motivation for this approach was that the solute dielectric-constant dependence of calculated hydration gas-to-water transfer free energies is markedly different from that of binding free energies {(J.} Comput. Chem. 2003, 24, 954). Hence, we sought to calibrate directly the solvation terms in the context of a binding calculation. The five parameters of the model were systematically scanned to best reproduce the absolute binding free energies for a set of 99 protein-ligand complexes. We obtained a mean unsigned error of 1.29 kcal/mol for the predicted absolute binding affinity in a parameter space that was fairly shallow near the optimum. The lowest errors were obtained with solute dielectric values of Din = 20 or higher and scaling of the intermolecular van der Waals interaction energy by factors ranging from 0.03 to 0.15. The high apparent Din and strong van der Waals scaling may reflect the anticorrelation of the change in solvated potential energy and configurational entropy, that is, enthalpy-entropy compensation in ligand binding {(Biophys.} J. 2004, 87, 3035-3049). Five variations of preparing the protein-ligand data set were explored in order to examine the effect of energy refinement and the presence of bound water on the calculated results. We find that retaining water in the final protein structure used for calculating the binding free energy is not necessary to obtain good results; that is the continuum solvation model is sufficient. Virtual screening enrichment studies on estrogen receptor and thymidine kinase showed a good ability of the binding free energy function to recover true hits in a collection of decoys.},

	abstract = {The standard framework for calculating the absolute binding free energy of a macromolecular association reaction A B -{\textgreater} {AB} with an association constant {K\_AB} is to equate chemical potentials of the species on the left- and right-hand sides of this reaction and evaluate the chemical potentials from theory. This theory involves (usually hidden) assumptions about what constitutes the bound species, {AB,} and where the contribution of the solvent appears. We present here an alternative derivation that can be traced back to Bjerrum, in which the expectation value of {K\_AB} is obtained directly through the statistical mechanical method of evaluating its ensemble {(Boltzmann-weighted)} average. The generalized Bjerrum approach more clearly delineates: (i) the different contributions to binding; (ii) the origin of the much-discussed and somewhat controversial association entropy term; and (iii) where the solvent contribution appears. This approach also allows approximations required for practical evaluation of the binding constant in complex macromolecular systems, to be introduced in a well defined way. We provide an example, with application to test cases that illustrate a range of binding behavior.},

The models exhibit the asymmetry that is sometimes seen in these calculations, in which the magnitude of the bias is greater when the calculation is performed in one direction {(A-{\textgreater}B,} sampling system A and perturbing into system B) versus the other {(B-{\textgreater}A),} Both models are formulated as a system of N independent particles, each sampling a space in the presence of a one-body field that is different for the A and B systems. In one model the field is a harmonic potential. The other model is discrete, such that each particle can be at one of two points (or states) of different energy. The neglected-tail bias model is applied to each system to estimate the average bias as a function of the amount of {FEP} sampling, and numerical calculations are performed to show that the bias model is effective. We show that the bias is significantly smaller when sampling is performed on the system having a broader work distribution (we designate this direction âinsertionâ ) compared to the bias for {FEP} calculations that sample the system with a narrower distribution (âdeletionâ)},

	volume = {108},
	doi = {10.1021/jp046520o},
	abstract = {Abstract: Relative binding free energies of amino acid derivatives to the host macrobicycle 12 in chloroform are calculated to determine the effect of stereochemistry and amide bond conformation. Simulations are performed for three different amino acid derivatives using Monte Carlo simulations, free energy perturbations, and the generalized Born/surface area solvation model. The free energy results support previous experimental findings that the L enantiomers of N-acetyl phenylalanine carboxylate and N-acetyl alanine carboxylate bind preferentially over the D enantiomers and that the amide bond is in the cis conformation for the bound L enantiomers. The enantioselectivity arises because of better shape complementarity, and the cis stabilization is achieved by a selective hydrogen bond to the cavity rim of the host and a remote steric stabilization of the side-chain 1 dihedral angle. This computational approach was also applied to N-acetyl glycine carboxylate and indicated that, for this amino acid derivative, both the trans and the cis forms of the acetyl amide can be accommodated within the macrobicycle cavity. Experimental evidence to support this finding was obtained by detailed {NMR} experiments on a 1:1 complex of M12 and N-acetyl glycine. The study demonstrates two important points regarding binding and conformation: First, the destabilization of the 1 dihedral angle of N-acetyl phenylalanine away from the most stable conformation appears to stabilize the cis conformation of the preceding amide bond, suggesting that amino acids other than proline might be able to increase the likelihood of cis amide bonds. More generally, internal conformational coupling is an important factor to consider in molecular recognition. Second, the comprehensive sampling protocol undertaken for this relatively small system that allows the host to adjust properly to each guest is shown to be crucial in obtaining converged free energies and different binding modes. Subtle changes in host geometry have profound effects on binding. Conversely, different binding modes arising from small changes in guest conformation, chirality, or side chain serve as a reminder that binding modes are not always transferable between apparently similar molecules.},

	abstract = {We consider the accuracy of several methods for combining forward and reverse free-energy perturbation averages for two systems (labeled 0 and 1). The practice of direct averaging of these measurements is argued as not reliable. Instead, methods are considered of the form {beta(A(1)-A(0))=-ln[{\textless}w(u)exp(-betau/2){\textgreater}(0)/{\textless}w(u)exp(+betau/2){\textgreater}(1)],} where A is the free energy, {beta=1/kT} is the reciprocal temperature, {u=U-1-U-0} is the difference in configurational energy, w(u) is a weighting function, and the angle brackets indicate an ensemble average performed on the system indicated by the subscript. Choices are considered in which w(u)=1 {andâcosh[(u-C)/2];} the latter being Bennett's method where C is a parameter that can be selected arbitrarily, and may be used to optimize the precision of the calculation. We examine the methods in several applications: calculation of the pressure of a square-well fluid by perturbing the volume, the chemical potential of a high-density {Lennard-Jones} system, and the chemical potential of a model for water. We find that the approaches based on Bennett's method weighting are very effective at ensuring an accurate result (one in which the systematic error arising from inadequate sampling is less than the estimated confidence limits), and that even the selection w(u)=1 offers marked improvement over comparable methods. We suggest that Bennett's method is underappreciated, and the benefits it offers for improved precision and (especially) accuracy are substantial, and therefore it should be more widely used. {(C)} 2003 American Institute of Physics.},

From the viewpoint of Monte Carlo, a slowly converging long-time Markov chain is replaced by a limited number of rapidly mixing short-time ones. Therefore, the state space of the chain has to be hierarchically decomposed into its metastable conformations. This is done by means of combining the technique of conformation analysis as recently introduced by the authors, and appropriate annealing strategies. We present a detailed examination of the uncoupling-coupling procedure which uncovers its theoretical background, and illustrates the hierarchical algorithmic approach. Furthermore, application of the {UCMC} algorithm to the n-pentane molecule allows us to discuss the effect of its crucial steps in a typical molecular scenario.},

	abstract = {The {AM1-BCC} method quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for use in condensed-phase simulations. The underlying features of the electron distribution including formal charge and delocalization are first captured by {AM1} atomic charges for the individual molecule. Bond charge corrections {(BCCs),} which have been parameterized against the {HF/6-31G*} electrostatic potential {(ESP)} of a training set of compounds containing relevant functional groups, are then added using a formalism identical to the consensus {BCI} (bond charge increment) approach. As a proof of the concept, we fit {BCCs} simultaneously to 45 compounds including O-, N-, and S-containing functionalities, aromatics, and heteroaromatics, using only 41 {BCC} parameters. {AM1-BCC} yields charge sets of comparable quality to {HF/6-31G*} {ESP-derived} charges in a fraction of the time while reducing instabilities in the atomic charges compared to direct {ESP-fit} methods. We then apply the {BCC} parameters to a small test set consisting of aspirin, d-glucose, and eryodictyol; the {AM1-BCC} model again provides atomic charges of quality comparable with {HF/6-31G*} {RESP} charges, as judged by an increase of only 0.01 to 0.02 atomic units in the root-mean-square {(RMS)} error in {ESP.} Based on these encouraging results, we intend to parameterize the {AM1-BCC} model to provide a consistent charge model for any organic or biological molecule.},

A cubic lattice model and a knowledge based force field are employed for these simulations. It is shown that, for a given amino acid sequence, the method is able to fold long polypeptides reproducibly. Its results compare favorably with those of annealing and parallel tempering simulations, which have been used before in the same context. This method is used to examine the effect of amino acid sequence and chain length on the folding of several designer polypeptides. {(C)} 2002 American Institute of Physics.},

Existing {OPLS-AA} torsional parameters for alkanes, alcohols, ethers, hemiacetals, esters ,and ketoamides were improved based on {MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ} and {MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ} calculations. Nonbonded parameters for the sp(3) carbon and oxygen atoms were refined using Monte Carlo simulations of bulk liquids. The resulting force field predicts conformer en ergies and torsional barriers of alkanes. alcohols, ethers, and hemiacetals with an overall {RMS} deviation of 0.40 kcal/mol as compared to reference data. Densities of 19 bulk liquids are predicted with an average error of 1.1\%. and heats of vaporization a -re reproduced within 2.4\% of experimental values. The force field was used to perform conformational analysis of smaller analogs of the macrocyclic polyketide drug {FK506.} Structures that adopted low-energy conformations similar to that of bound {FK506} wer e identified. The results show that a linker of four ketide units constitutes the shortest effector domain that allows binding of the ketide drugs to {FKBP} proteins. It is proposed that the exact chemical makeup of the effector domain has little influence on the conformational preference of tetraketides. {(C)} 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

This method uses a stack of grid software, which we call {STIMD,} that allows the scientist to easily distribute the necessary simulations around a computational grid thereby accelerating the process. We use this method to study how a series of phosphopeptides binds to the Src {SH2} domain. The binding of phosphopeptides to the Src {SH2} domain is described by the "two-pronged plug two-holed socket" model, and we investigate this model by reducing the length of the aliphatic side chain that engages the second of the two sockets through two successive alchemical mutations. Seven different values of G have been calculated, and we report good agreement with experiment. We then propose an extension to this model using the insights gained from a free energy component analysis.},

	abstract = {Reliable structure-prediction methods for membrane proteins are important because the experimental determination of high-resolution membrane protein structures remains very difficult, especially for eukaryotic proteins. However, membrane proteins are typically longer than 200 aa and represent a formidable challenge for structure prediction. We have developed a method for predicting the structures of large membrane proteins by constraining helixâhelix packing arrangements at particular positions predicted from sequence or identified by experiments. We tested the method on 12 membrane proteins of diverse topologies and functions with lengths ranging between 190 and 300 residues. Enforcing a single constraint during the folding simulations enriched the population of near-native models for 9 proteins. In 4 of the cases in which the constraint was predicted from the sequence, 1 of the 5 lowest energy models was superimposable within 4 Ã on the native structure. Near-native structures could also be selected for heme-binding and pore-forming domains from simulations in which pairs of conserved histidine-chelating hemes and one experimentally determined salt bridge were constrained, respectively. These results suggest that models within 4 Ã of the native structure can be achieved for complex membrane proteins if even limited information on residue-residue interactions can be obtained from protein structure databases or experiments.},

We propose a new definition of Helfand moment which takes into account the minimum image convention used in molecular dynamics with periodic boundary conditions. Our Helfand-moment method is equivalent to the method based on the {Green-Kubo} formula and is not affected by ambiguities due to the periodic boundary conditions. Moreover, in hard-ball systems, our method is equivalent to that developed by Alder, Gass, and Wainwright {[J.} Chem. Phys. 53, 3813 (1970)]. We apply and verify our method in a fluid composed of Ngreater than or equal to2 hard disks in elastic collisions. We show that the viscosity coefficients already take values in good agreement with Enskog's theory for N=2 hard disks in a hexagonal geometry.},

However, accurately studying the unfolded state with computer simulation is difficult, due to its complexity and the great deal of sampling required. Using a supercluster of over 10,000 processors we have performed close to 800 mus of molecular dynamics simulation in atomistic detail of the folded and unfolded states of three polypeptides from a range of structural classes: the all-alpha villin headpiece molecule, the beta hairpin tryptophan zipper, and a designed alpha-beta zinc finger mimic. A comparison between the folded and the unfolded ensembles reveals that, even though virtually none of the individual members of the unfolded ensemble exhibits native-like features, the mean unfolded structure (averaged over the entire unfolded ensemble) has a native-like geometry. This suggests several novel implications for protein folding and structure prediction as well as new interpretations for experiments which find structure in ensemble-averaged measurements. {(C)} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In this multiconfiguration thermodynamic integration technique, the commonly employed single configuration (slow growth) approximation is not made. It is shown, by analysis of the sources of error, how the multiconfiguration variant of thermodynamic integration allows for a soundly based assessment of the statistical error in the evaluated free energy difference. Since ensembles of configurations are generated for each integration step, a statistical error can be evaluated for each integration step. By generating ensembles of different lengths, the statistical error can be equally distributed over the integration. This eliminates the difficult problem in single configuration thermodynamic integrations of determining the best rate of change of the Hamiltonian, which is usually based on equally distributing the free energy change. At the same time, this procedure leads to a more efficient use of computer time by providing the possibility of added accuracy from separate calculations of the same Hamiltonian change. The technique is applied to a simple but illustrative model system consisting of a monatomic solute in aqueous solution. In a second example, a combination of multiconfiguration thermodynamic integration and thermodynamic perturbation is used to obtain the potentials of mean force for rotation of the sidechain dihedral angles for valine and threonine dipeptides with restrained backbones in aqueous solution.},

A combination of two strategies are used: (i) to use a pathway for particle insertions that avoids large variations in free energy and (ii) to use calculated free energy derivatives to construct a bias potential that makes the pathway fairly level. Only a few very short simulations are needed to accomplish the latter, and then, a full {EE} simulation is done to obtain the chemical potential. By practical calculations of the chemical potential of benzene, cyclohexane, and benzylamine in water, it is shown that this method is at least equally efficient to the recent adaptive {EE} {(AEE)} method by berg et al. {(J.} Chem. Phys. 2004, 120, 3370). Furthermore, the new method provides an alternative strategy that complements existing {EE} methods.},

Expressions for estimating the bias in maximum likelihood estimates have been given by Cox and Hinkley (1974), {(Theoretical} Statistics, Chapman \& Hall, London). In this paper, a new simple expression is derived for estimating the first-order bias in maximum likelihood estimates. This is then applied to certain specific models; namely, estimating the bias in the concentration parameter in the von {Mises-Fisher} distribution - for which there are some ad hoc results in the literature {(Best} and Fisher, 1981, Comm. Statist. Ser. B. Simulation Comput. 31, 493-502)- and for the scale parameter in the Cauchy distribution. In both problems, the first-order bias is found to be linear in the parameter and the sample size. Simulations are used to verify our theoretical results and to give some indication of how large the parameter and the sample size need to be for our estimates of bias to hold well. {(C)} 1999 Elsevier Science {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

The continuing expansion of computational power with time makes it possible to compute ever more properties for an increasing variety of molecular systems with greater precision. This has led to recurrent parameterizations of the {GROMOS} force field all aimed at achieving better agreement with experimental data. Here we report the results of the latest, extensive reparameterization of the {GROMOS} force field. In contrast to the parameterization of other biomolecular force fields, this parameterization of the {GROMOS} force field is based primarily on reproducing the free enthalpies of hydration and apolar solvation for a range of compounds. This approach was chosen because the relative free enthalpy of solvation between polar and apolar environments is a key property in many biomolecular processes of interest, such as protein folding, biomolecular association, membrane formation, and transport over membranes. The newest parameter sets, {53A5} and {53A6,} were optimized by first fitting to reproduce the thermodynamic properties of pure liquids of a range of small polar molecules and the solvation free enthalpies of amino acid analogs in cyclohexane {(53A5).} The partial charges were then adjusted to reproduce the hydration free enthalpies in water {(53A6).} Both parameter sets are fully documented, and the differences between these and previous parameter sets are discussed},

	abstract = {Abstract: The prokaryotic monotopic membrane protein squalene-hopene cyclase {(SHC)} is homologous to a human enzyme responsible for cholesterol formation. Using molecular dynamics in explicit water, a single monomer of {SHC} was simulated using the {GROMOS} {45A3} force field, once in complex with an inhibitor and once in an uncomplexed form. The protein exhibits significant stability on the level of secondary and tertiary structure even outside of its native membrane environment. Analysis of the fluctuations of the complexed and the uncomplexed {SHC} confirms the previously made suggestions for the ligand entrance channel and reveals some of its novel dynamical features that might be of functional importance. To examine the potential of computationally designing {SHC} ligands and study their thermodynamics of binding, the relative free energies of binding of a series of structurally similar anticholesteremic inhibitors of {SHC} were calculated using single-step perturbation {(SSP)} and thermodynamic integration {(TI)} techniques. While neither technique succeeds in quantitatively matching the relatively small experimental values, {TI} qualitatively reproduces the relative order of the experimental affinities, but {SSP} does not. Detailed comparisons and potential reasons for this are given.},

	abstract = {Drug resistance is a significant obstacle in the effective treatment of diseases with rapidly mutating targets, such as {AIDS,} malaria, and certain forms of cancer. Such targets are remarkably efficient at exploring the space of functional mutants and at evolving to evade drug binding while still maintaining their biological role. To overcome this challenge, drug regimens must be active against potential target variants. Such a goal may be accomplished by one drug molecule that recognizes multiple variants or by a drug "cocktail"-a small collection of drug molecules that collectively binds all desired variants. Ideally, one wants the smallest cocktail possible due to the potential for increased toxicity with each additional drug. Therefore, the task of designing a regimen for multiple target variants can be framed as an optimization problem-find the smallest collection of molecules that together "covers" the relevant target variants. In this work, we formulate and apply this optimization framework to theoretical model target ensembles. These results are analyzed to develop an understanding of how the physical properties of a target ensemble relate to the properties of the optimal cocktail. We focus on electrostatic variation within target ensembles, as it is one important mechanism by which drug resistance is achieved. Using integer programming, we systematically designed optimal cocktails to cover model target ensembles. We found that certain drug molecules covered much larger regions of target space than others, a phenomenon explained by theory grounded in continuum electrostatics. Molecules within optimal cocktails were often dissimilar, such that each drug was responsible for binding variants with a certain electrostatic property in common. On average, the number of molecules in the optimal cocktails correlated with the number of variants, the differences in the variants' electrostatic properties at the binding interface, and the level of binding affinity required. We also treated cases in which a subset of target variants was to be avoided, modeling the common challenge of closely related host molecules that may be implicated in drug toxicity. Such decoys generally increased the size of the required cocktail and more often resulted in infeasible optimizations. Taken together, this work provides practical optimization methods for the design of drug cocktails and a theoretical, physics-based framework through which useful insights can be achieved.},

In this united-atom force field, the nonbonded interactions of the hydrocarbon pseudo-atoms are solely governed by {Lennard-Jones} 12-6 potentials, and the {Lennard-Jones} well depth and size parameters for the new pseudoatoms were determined by fitting to the single-component vapor-liquid-phase equilibria of a few selected model compounds. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the {NVT} version of the Gibbs ensemble were carried out to calculate the single-component vapor-liquid coexistence curves for ethene, propene, I-butene, trans- and cis-2-butene, 2-methylpropene, 1,5-hexadiene, 1-octene, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, propylbenzene, isopropylbenzene, o-, m-, and p-xylene, and naphthalene. The phase diagrams for the binary mixtures of (supercritical) ethene/n-heptane and benzene/n-pentane were determined from simulations in the {NPT} Gibbs ensemble. Although the {TraPPE-UA} force field is rather simple and makes use of relatively few different pseudo-atoms, its performance, as judged by comparisons to other popular force fields and available experimental data, is very satisfactory.},

	abstract = {A three-dimensional model structure of a complex formed by a G-protein-coupled receptor {(GPCR)} and an agonist ligand is probed and refined using molecular-dynamics simulations and free energy calculations in a realistic environment. The model of the human receptor of cholecystokinin associated to agonist ligand {CCK9} was obtained from a synergistic procedure combining site-directed mutagenesis experiments and in silico modeling. The 31-ns molecular-dynamics simulation in an explicit membrane environment indicates that both the structure of the receptor and its interactions with the ligand are robust. Whereas the secondary structure of the alpha-helix bundle is well preserved, the region of the intracellular loops exhibits a significant flexibility likely to be ascribed to the absence of G-protein subunits in the model. New insight into the structural features of the binding pocket is gained, in particular, the interplay of the ligand with both the receptor and internal water molecules. Water-mediated interactions are shown to participate in the binding, hence, suggesting additional site-directed mutagenesis experiments. Accurate free energy calculations on mutated ligands provide differences in the receptor-ligand binding affinity, thus offering a direct, quantitative comparison to experiment. We propose that this detailed consistency-checking procedure be used as a routine refinement step of in vacuo {GPCR} models, before further investigation and application to structure-based drug design.},

Monte Carlo simulation is an effective technique, especially with complex and high-dimensional models. This paper aims to bring to the attention of general statistical audiences of some effective methods originating from theoretical physics and at the same time to explore these methods from a more statistical perspective, through establishing theoretical. connections and illustrating their uses with statistical problems. We show that the acceptance ratio method and thermodynamic integration are natural generalizations of importance sampling, which is most familiar to statistical audiences. The former generalizes importance sampling through the use of a single âbridgeâ density and is thus a case of bridge sampling in the sense of Meng and Wong. Thermodynamic integration, which is also known in the numerical analysis literature as Ogata's method for high-dimensional integration, corresponds to the use of infinitely many and continuously connected bridges (and thus a âpathâ). Our path sampling formulation offers more flexibility and thus potential efficiency to thermodynamic integration, and the search of optimal paths turns out to have close connections with the Jeffreys prior density and the Rao and Hellinger distances between two densities. We provide an informative theoretical example as well as two empirical examples (involving 17- to 70-dimensional integrations) to illustrate the potential and implementation of path sampling. We also discuss some open problems.},

The structures of the protein and the macroli de are remarkably similar to those seen in the complexes with tacrolimus and ascomycin.

	volume = {100},
	doi = {10.1063/1.466667},
	abstract = {Various methods are compared for calculating the constraint free energy in simulations with change of bond lengths. Bond forces can be evaluated as restraint forces with the use of flexible bonds, and also, when bond lengths are held fixed, as constraint forces calculated either from {SHAKE} displacements, or else from Gauss' principle of least constraint, and these forces can then be used to calculate the potential of mean force or free energy for the bond length changes. An alternative is to use so-called mean-potential forces. Analysis of the equations derived from Gauss' principle shows that the constraint force (and also the restraint force) contain a âdynamicâ term, that depends on the molecular motion and for simple molecules averages to 2 {kT/r,} where r is the bond length. Integration of this term, which is not present with use of the mean-potential force, or in a Monte Carlo simulation, gives a free energy that corresponds to the change in conformational entropy of two particles maintained at a certain distance, when this distance is changed. It is unnecessary to compute this free energy term by simulation, as was done in earlier work. The accuracy and precision of these methods, and of methods in which the bond lengths do not change, are tested in a series of model calculations of increasing complexity. First, the equivalence of these methods is tested in a model system with small molecules whose motion is maintained by Brownian dynamics, and which can be subjected to very simple external forces, in order to permit very long {simulations.Second,} a comparison is made of techniques for calculating free energy change with and without change of bond lengths, applied to the transformation of ethane into ethanol in water. A third test system is the conversion of an alanine residue into a serine residue in an alpha-helix in water. It is found that results are much improved if the âvanishingâ atoms (in this case hydroxyl O and H) are coupled to a heat bath via Brownian forces. Statistical errors are estimated from four successive slow-growth simulation cycles. Calculations with twofold change of {C-O} and {O-H} bond lengths and linear coupling of the nonbonded energy terms are more precise than calculations without change of bond lengths and nonlinear coupling. The free energy change for the system with flexible bonds contains a significant contribution (circa 3 {kJ} mol) from elongation of the bond lengths as a result of interaction of the polar {OH} group with water. The constraint forces calculated from the {SHAKE} displacements and from Gauss' principle turn out to be almost identical. The three methods for calculating the constraint forces achieve similar precision in the ethane/ethanol system as well as in the alpha-helix system. We also discuss the application of free energy calculations with changing bond lengths to changes of a molecule's chemistry in the middle of a chain.},

Here, we examine the effects of âconservativeâ and 'Åonconservativeâ subs titutions on the X-ray crystal structures of human recombinant {FKBP12} mutants in complex with the immunosuppressant drug {FK506} (tacrolimus). {R42K} and {R42I} mutant complexes show 110-fold and 180-fold decreased calcineurin {(CN)} inhibition, respectively, ver sus the native complex, yet retain full peptidyl prolyl isomerase {(PPIase)} activity, {FK506} binding, and {FK506-mediated} {PPIase} inhibition. Interestingly, the structure of the {R42I} mutant complex is better conserved than that of the {R42K} mutant complex when compared to the native complex structure, within both the {FKBP12} protein and {FK506} ligand regions of the complexes, and with respect to temperature factors and {RMS} coordinate differences. This is due to compensatory interactions mediated by two newly ord ered water molecules in the {R42I} complex structure, molecules that act as surrogates for the missing arginine guanidino nitrogens of R42. The absence of such surrogate solvent interactions in the {R42K} complex leads to some disorder in the so-called â40s loopâ that encompasses the substituent. One rationalization proposed for the observed loss in {CN} inhibition in these R42 mutant complexes invokes indirect effects leading to a misorientation of {FKBP12} and {FK506} structural elements that normally interact with calcineurin. Our results with the structure of the {R42I} complex in particular suggest that the observed loss of {CN} inhibition might also be explained by the loss of a specific R42-mediated interaction with {CN} that cannot be mimicked effectively by th e solvent molecules that otherwise stabilize the conformation of the 40s loop in that structure.},

In view of the resolution of the experimentally determined structures of {FKBP12} and relatively small difference of the receptor binding sites between the complexed and uncomple xed stares, it is unclear if the conformational induction mechanism is relevant to the binding of {FKBP12} with its ligands. Alternatively, we advocate a conformation selection mechanism fundamentally akin to a mechanism proposed by Burgen. This mechanism b etter explains the experimental and calculated results for the binding of {FKBP12} with {FK506.} It emphasizes that both guest and host select their most compatible preformed conformers to effect binding, and that the observed free energy of binding is a sum of the free energy change in complexation of the two most compatible conformers and the free energy changes in conversion of the Boltzmann-weighted principal conformers to the most compatible conformers. Conceptually, this mechanism represents one physica l or nonphysical path of a thermodynamic cycle that is closed by the other path represented by the conformational induction mechanism, which can also be physical or nonphysical; it provides a theoretical means to estimate the affinity of the guest to the host with the experimentally available {3D} structures of the two partners.},

	abstract = {In free energy calculations based on thermodynamic integration, it is necessary to compute the derivatives of the free energy as a function of one (scalar case) or several (vector case) order parameters. We derive in a compact way a general formulation for evaluating these derivatives as the average of a mean force acting on the order parameters, which involves first derivatives with respect to both Cartesian coordinates and time. This is in contrast with the previously derived formulas, which require first and second derivatives of the order parameter with respect to Cartesian coordinates. As illustrated in a concrete example, the main advantage of this new formulation is the simplicity of its use, especially for complicated order parameters. It is also straightforward to implement in a molecular dynamics code, as can be seen from the pseudocode given at the end. We further discuss how the approach based on time derivatives can be combined with the adaptive biasing force method, an enhanced sampling technique that rapidly yields uniform sampling of the order parameters, and by doing so greatly improves the efficiency of free energy calculations. Using the backbone dihedral angles Phi and Psi in {N-acetylalanyl-N[prime]-methylamide} as a numerical example, we present a technique to reconstruct the free energy from its derivatives, a calculation that presents some difficulties in the vector case because of the statistical errors affecting the derivatives.},

Several approved anti-influenza drugs effectively target the neuraminidase {(NA),} a surface glycoprotein that cleaves terminal sialic acid residues and facilitates the release of viral progeny from infected cells. The first crystal structures of group-1 {NAs} revealed that although the binding pose of oseltamivir was similar to that seen in previous crystallographic complexes, the 150-loop adopted a distinct conformation, opening a new cavity adjacent to the active site. Here we show that the 150-loop is able to open into significantly wider conformations than seen in the crystal structures, through explicitly solvated {MD} simulations of the apo and oseltamivir-bound forms of tetrameric N1. We find that motion in the 150-loop is coupled to motion in the neighboring 430-loop, which expands the active site cavity even further. Furthermore, in simulations of the oseltamivir-bound system, the 150-loop approaches the closed conformation, suggesting that the loop switching motion may be more rapid than previously observed.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The widespread use of surfactant mixtures and surfactant/solubilizate mixtures in practical applications motivates the development of predictive theoretical approaches to improve fundamental understanding of the behavior of these complex self-assembling systems and to facilitate the design and optimization of new surfactant and surfactant/solubilizate mixtures. This paper is the first of two articles introducing a new computer simulation-free-energy/molecular thermodynamic {(CS-FE/MT)} model. The two articles explore the application of computer simulation free-energy methods to quantify the thermodynamics associated with mixed surfactant/cosurfactant and surfactant/solubilizate micelle formation in aqueous solution. In this paper (article 1 of the series), a theoretical approach is introduced to use computer simulation free-energy methods to compute the free-energy change associated with changing micelle composition (referred to as Gi). In this approach, experimental critical micelle concentration {(CMC)} data, or a molecular thermodynamic model of micelle formation, is first used to evaluate the free energy associated with single (pure) surfactant micelle formation, gform,single, in which the single surfactant micelle contains only surfactant A molecules. An iterative approach is proposed to combine the estimated value of gform,single with free-energy estimates of Gi based on computer simulation to determine the optimal free energy of mixed micelle formation, the optimal micelle aggregation number and composition, and the optimal bulk solution composition. After introducing the {CS-FE/MT} modeling framework, a variety of free-energy methods are briefly reviewed, and the selection of the thermodynamic integration free-energy method is justified and selected to implement the {CS-FE/MT} model. An alchemical free-energy pathway is proposed to allow evaluation of the free-energy change associated with exchanging a surfactant A molecule with a surfactant/solubilizate B molecule through thermodynamic integration. In article 2 of this series, the implementation of the {CS-FE/MT} model to make Gi free-energy predictions for several surfactant/solubilizate systems is discussed, and the predictions of the {CS-FE/MT} model are compared with the Gi predictions of a molecular thermodynamic model fitted to relevant experimental data.},

Subsequently, we propose a relevant classification of the protein kinase family based on the structural similarity of its binding sites.

Interest in studying amines and fluorine-substituted compounds has risen from their intrinsic physicochemical properties and their prevalence in biological and pharmaceutical compounds. In the present study, a previously developed approach which optimizes {Lennard-Jones} {(LJ)} parameters via the use of rare gas atoms combined with the reproduction of experimental condensed phase properties was extended to polar-neutral compounds. Compounds studied included four amines (ammonia, methylamine, dimethylamine, and trimethylamine) and three fluoroethanes (1-fluoroethane, 1,1-difluoroethane, and 1,1,1-trifluoroethane). The resulting force field yielded heats of vaporization and molecular volumes in excellent agreement with the experiment, with average differences less than 1\%. The current amine {CHARMM} parameters successfully reproduced experimental aqueous solvation data where methylamine is more hydrophilic than ammonia. with hydrophobicity increasing with additional methylation on the nitrogen. For both the amines and fluoroethanes the parabolic relationship of the extent of methylation or fluorination, respectively, to the heats of vaporization were reproduced by the new parameters. The present results are also discussed with respect to the impact of parameterization approach to molecular details obtained from computer simulations and to the unique biological properties of fluorine in pharmaceutical compounds. {(C)} 2002 John Wiley Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {We use the thermodynamic integration technique to calculate the free energy associated with the Tyr82 â{\textgreater} Phe82 mutation {(Y82F)} in the protein {FKBP-12,} both free and bound to known inhibitor {FK506} (tacrolimis). We find that the net difference in free energy for the two changes is 0.85 kcal/mol, with the binding of {FK506} relatively more favorable for the native protein than the mutant. This net energy compares very favorably with the experimentally measured value of 0.60 kcal/mol. The results indicate that the relatively better binding of {FK506} to the native protein is driven by the favorable entropy associated with the release of water molecules from the protein when the ligand binds. For a variety of reasons, modest size of the system, smallness of the change being examined, rapid convergence of the ensemble that needs to be determined and use of statistical estimates to control sampling, we have been able to carry out atypically reliable and reproducible free energy calculations for this protein system. Free energy changes for the two simulations {(Y82F} {FKBP-12/FK506} and {Y82F} {FKBP-12)} have been calculated a total of eight times each, to compare a variety of different methodological choices and to ensure that the results are statistically significant. Detailed analysis of the free energy results has been carried out, and indicates that even when applicable, deconvolution of the total free energy into components can be very difficult, that the statistical error estimates can give a reasonable bound on the error in a simulation, and that one must be careful to use the same simulation protocol in all simulations being compared.},

	abstract = {A modified thermodynamic integration technique is presented to obtain free energy differences from molecular dynamics simulations. In this multiconfiguration thermodynamic integration technique, the commonly employed single configuration (slow growth) approximation is not made. It is shown, by analysis of the sources of error, how the multiconfiguration variant of thermodynamic integration allows for a soundly based assessment of the statistical error in the evaluated free energy difference. Since ensembles of configurations are generated for each integration step, a statistical error can be evaluated for each integration step. By generating ensembles of different lengths, the statistical error can be equally distributed over the integration. This eliminates the difficult problem in single configuration thermodynamic integrations of determining the best rate of change of the Hamiltonian, which is usually based on equally distributing the free energy change. At the same time, this procedure leads to a more efficient use of computer time by providing the possibility of added accuracy from separate calculations of the same leads to a more efficient use of computer time by providing the possibility of added accuracy from separate calculations of the same Hamiltonian change. The technique is applied to a simple but illustrative model system consisting of a monatomic solute in aqueous solution. In a second example, a combination of multiconfiguration thermodynamic integration and thermodynamic perturbation is used to obtain the potentials of mean force for rotation of the sidechain dihedral angles for valine and threonine dipeptides with restrained backbones in aqueous solution.},

The {SGB-LIE} predictions and cross-validation results show that about 1.0 kcal/mol accuracy is achievable for binding sets with as many as 20 ligands, e.g., for the {HIV-1} {RT} binding set, {RMS} errors of 1.07 and 1.20 kcal/mol are achieved for {LIE} fitting and leave-one-out cross validation, respectively, with correlation coefficients r(2) equal to 0.774 and 0.717.

Despite its widespread use, questions remain about its efficiency compared with conventional, constant temperature molecular dynamics {(MD).} An analytic approach is taken to describe the relative efficiency of {REMD} with respect to {MD.} This is applied to several simple two-state models and to several real proteinsprotein L and the B domain of protein Ato predict the relative efficiency of {REMD} with respect to {MD} in actual applications. In agreement with others, we find the following: as long as there is a positive activation energy for folding, {REMD} is more efficient than {MD;} the effectiveness of {REMD} is strongly dependent on the activation enthalpy; and the efficiency of {REMD} for actual proteins is a strong function of the maximum temperature. Choosing the maximum temperature too high can result in {REMD} becoming significantly less efficient than conventional {MD.} A good rule of thumb appears to be to choose the maximum temperature of the {REMD} simulation slightly above the temperature at which the enthalpy for folding vanishes. Additionally, we find that the number of replicas in {REMD,} while important for simulations shorter than one or two relaxation times, has a minimal effect on the asymptotic efficiency of the method.},

While the method is valid for arbitrary Ï0, we speculate that an accurate choice of the reference distribution improves the convergence of the method. Using a model molecule, simulated both in vacuum and in solvent, we validate our proposed approach and compare its performance with the histogram and thermodynamic integration methods.

Compared to one-dimensional adaptive umbrella sampling with the potential energy as umbrella coordinate (multicanonical sampling), more reliable results can be obtained in certain cases. The method is applied to a helical peptide {(RN24)} with an analytical continuum solvent potential in combination with the {PARAM19} force field of {CHARMM.} This effective potential energy function has been shown to describe the structural preferences of solvated peptides. With the two-dimensional approach and the deviation from the helical structure as the second umbrella coordinate, a converged description of the structural properties and the thermodynamics of the peptide {RN24} is obtained. In particular, we find that the formation of the helix of {RN24} occurs as a transition accompanied by a characteristic peak in the heat capacity. A formalism is described that uses the weighting factors obtained from a self-consistent solution of the weighted histogram analysis method equations to combine the results from a series of simulations with different biases and calculate the ensemble average of any dynamical variable as a function of the temperature without the need for extracting the density of states from the simulations. It is shown how the formalism can be used to calculate thermodynamic properties of the system. {(C)} 1999 American Institute of Physics. {[S0021-9606(99)50340-1].}},

	abstract = {It is widely accepted that the binding constant of a receptor and ligand can be written as a two-body integral involving the interaction energy of the receptor and the ligand. Interestingly, however, three different theories of binding in the literature dictate three distinct integrals. The present study uses theory, as well as simulations of binding experiments, to test the validity of the three integrals. When binding is measured by a signal that detects the ligand in the binding site, the most accurate results are obtained by an integral of the Boltzmann factor, where the bound complex is defined in terms of an exclusive binding region. A novel prediction of this approach, that expanding a ligand can increase its binding constant, is borne out by the simulations. The simulations also show that abnormal binding isotherms can be obtained when the region over which the signal is detected deviates markedly from the exclusion zone. Interestingly, the binding constant measured by equilibrium dialysis, rather than by monitoring a localized signal, can yield a binding constant that differs from that obtained from a signal measurement, and that is matched best by the integral of the Mayer factor.},

The study is limited to a single state point and system size. In accord with recent arguments made in the context of the hard-sphere model, we find that any single- or multi-stage approach that incorporates a 'deletion' component shows greatly diminished accuracy and precision when compared to its 'insertion' counterpart. We also confirm our earlier conjecture that the entropy rather than the free energy is the important quantity to examine when formulating optimal multistage free-energy perturbation schemes. {(C)} 1998 Elsevier Science {B.V.} All rights reserved.},

Most practitioners seem to agree that {QSAR} has not fulfilled the expectations set for its ability to predict biological activity. Among the possible reasons that have been proposed recently for this disappointment are chance correlation, rough response surfaces, incorrect functional forms, and overtraining. Undoubtedly, each of these plays an important role in the lack of predictivity seen in most {QSAR} models. Likely to be just as important is the role of the fallacy cum hoc ergo propter hoc in the poor prediction seen with many {QSAR} models. By embracing fallacy along with an over reliance on statistical inference, it may well be that the manner in which {QSAR} is practiced is more responsible for its lack of success than any other innate cause.},

	volume = {95},
	abstract = {Although it is well known that the free energy perturbation procedure is exact when an infinite sample of configuration space is used, for finite sample size there is a systematic error resulting in hysteresis for forward and backward simulations. The qualitative behavior of this systematic error is first explored for a Gaussian distribution, then a first-order estimate of the error for any distribution is derived. To first order the error depends only on the fluctuations in the sample of potential energies, {DELTA-E,} and the sample size, n, but not on the magnitude of {DELTA-E.} The first-order estimate of the systematic sample-size error is used to compare the efficiencies of various computing strategies. It is found that slow-growth, free energy perturbation calculations will always have lower errors from this source than window-growth, free energy perturbation calculations for the same computing effort. The systematic sample-size errors can be entirely eliminated by going to thermodynamic integration rather than free energy perturbation calculations. When {DELTA-E} is a very smooth function of the coupling parameter, lambda, thermodynamic integration with a relatively small number of windows is the recommended procedure because the time required for equilibration is reduced with a small number of windows. The present results give a method of estimating this sample-size hysteresis during the course of a slow-growth, free energy perturbation run. This is important because in these calculations time-lag and sample-size errors can cancel, so that separate methods of estimating and correcting for each are needed. When dynamically modified window procedures are used, it is recommended that the estimated sample-size error be kept constant, not that the magnitude of {DELTA-E} be kept constant. Tests on two systems showed a rather small sample-size hysteresis in slow-growth calculations except in the first stages of creating a particle, where both fluctuations and sample-size hysteresis are large.},

	copyright = {(c)2004 Institute for Scientific Information, Inc.},
	abstract = {A fluctuating charge {(FQ)} force field is applied to molecular dynamics simulations for six small proteins in explicit polarizable solvent represented by the {TIP4P-FQ} potential. The proteins include {1FSV,} {1ENH,} {1PGB,} {1VII,} {1H8K,} and {1CRN,} representing both helical and beta-sheet secondary structural elements. Constant pressure and temperature {(NPT)} molecular dynamics simulations are performed on time scales of several nanoseconds, the longest simulations yet reported using explicitly polarizable all-atom empirical potentials (for both solvent and protein) in the condensed phase. In terms of structure, the {FQ} force field allows deviations from native structure up to 2.5 Angstrom (with a range of 1.0 to 2.5 Angstrom). This is commensurate to the performance of the {CHARMM22} nonpolarizable model and other currently existing polarizable models. Importantly, secondary structural elements maintain native structure in general to within 1 Angstrom (both helix and beta-strands), again in good agreement with the nonpolarizable case. In qualitative agreement with {QM/MM} ab initio dynamics on crambin {(Liu} et al. Proteins 2001, 44, 484), there is a sequence dependence of average condensed phase atomic charge for all proteins, a dependence one would anticipate considering the differing chemical environments around individual atoms; this is a subtle quantum mechanical feature captured in the {FQ} model but absent in current state-of-the-art nonpolarizable models. Furthermore, there is a mutual polarization of solvent and protein in the condensed phase. Solvent dipole moment distributions within the first and second solvation shells around the protein display a shift towards higher dipole moments (increases on the order of 0.2-0.3 Debye) relative to the bulk; protein polarization is manifested via the enhanced condensed phase charges of typical polar atoms such as backbone carbonyl oxygens, amide nitrogens, and amide hydrogens. Finally, to enlarge the sample set of proteins, gas-phase minimizations and 1 ps constant temperature simulations are performed on various-sized proteins to compare to earlier work by Kaminsky et al. {(J} Comp Chem 2002, 23, 1515). The present work establishes the feasibility of applying a fully polarizable force field for protein simulations and demonstrates the approach employed in extending the {CHARMM} force field to include these effects. {(C)} 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Because complex systems often undergo nontrivial structural transition during state switching, achieving efficient free-energy calculation can be challenging. As identified earlier, the {âHamiltonianâ} lagging, which reveals the fact that necessary structural relaxation falls behind the order parameter move, has been a primary problem for generally low free-energy simulation efficiency. Here, we propose an algorithm by achieving a random walk in both the order parameter space and its generalized force space; thereby, the order parameter move and the required conformational relaxation can be efficiently synchronized. As demonstrated in both the alchemical transition and the conformational transition, a leapfrog improvement in free-energy simulation efficiency can be obtained; for instance, () it allows us to solve a notoriously challenging problem: accurately predicting the value of a buried titratable residue, Asp-66, in the interior of the {V66E} staphylococcal nuclease mutant, and () it allows us to gain superior efficiency over the metadynamics algorithm.},

Two conformations of the macrocy clic ring are sampled during the simulation, and some exocyclic groups undergo rapid conformational changes. Considerable flexibility is also observed near the amide functionality, which is in the binding region of {FK506.} The hydration of {FK506} shows inte resting variations owing to differences in the steric environments of potential hydrogen-bonding sites.

	abstract = {A modified thermodynamic integration technique is presented to obtain free energy differences from molecular dynamics simulations. In this multiconfiguration thermodynamic integration technique, the commonly employed single configuration (slow growth) approximation is not made. It is shown, by analysis of the sources of error, how the multiconfiguration variant of thermodynamic integration allows for a soundly based assessment of the statistical error in the evaluated free energy difference. Since ensembles of configurations are generated for each integration step, a statistical error can be evaluated for each integration step. By generating ensembles of different lengths, the statistical error can be equally distributed over the integration. This eliminates the difficult problem in single configuration thermodynamic integrations of determining the best rate of change of the Hamiltonian, which is usually based on equally distributing the free energy change. At the same time, this procedure leads to a more efficient use of computer time by providing the possibility of added accuracy from separate calculations of the same Hamiltonian change. The technique is applied to a simple but illustrative model system consisting of a monatomic solute in aqueous solution. In a second example, a combination of multiconfiguration thermodynamic integration and thermodynamic perturbation is used to obtain the potentials of mean force for rotation of the sidechain dihedral angles for valine and threonine dipeptides with restrained backbones in aqueous solution.},

	title = {End-bridging Monte Carlo: A fast algorithm for atomistic simulation of condensed phases of long polymer chains},
	volume = {32},
	abstract = {The recently introduced end-bridging {(EB)} Monte Carlo move is revisited, and a thorough analysis of its geometric formulation and numerical implementation is given. Detailed results are presented from applying the move, along with concerted rotation, in atomistic simulations of polyethylene {(PE)} melt systems with mean molecular lengths ranging from C-78 up to C-500, flat molecular weight distributions, and polydispersity indices I ranging from 1.02 to 1.12. To avoid finite system-size effects, most simulations are executed in a superbox containing up to 5000 mers and special neighbor list strategies are implemented. For all chain lengths considered, excellent equilibration is observed of the thermodynamic and conformational properties of the melt at all length scales, from the level of the bond length to the level of the chain end-to-end vector. In sharp contrast, if no end bridging is allowed among the Monte Carlo moves, no equilibration is achieved, even for the C-78 system. The polydispersity index I is found to have no effect on the equilibrium properties of the melt. To quantify the efficiency of the {EB} Monte Carlo move, the {CPU} time to required for the chain center of mass to travel a distance equal to the root-mean-square end-to-end distance is estimated by simple analytical arguments. It is found that to should scale as {n/((X)} over bar Delta(2.5)), where n is the total number of mers in the system, {(X)} over bar is the average chain length, and Delta similar or equal to {[3(I} - 1)](1/2) is the reduced width of the chain-length distribution function. This means that, if the size of the model system and the shape of the chain-length distribution are kept constant, systems of larger average molecular weight equilibrate faster, a remarkable attribute of the {EB} Monte Carlo method. The simulation results obey the estimated scaling of t(0) with {(X)} over bar, n, and Delta remarkably well in the range of chain lengths and polydispersities for which the premises of the analysis are not violated (mean chain lengths greater than C-156 and polydispersity indices above about 1.07). Results for volumetric behavior, structure, and chain conformation at temperature T = 450 K and pressure P ranging from 1 to 800 atm are presented, using three different {PE} united atom models proposed in the recent literature. All three models are shown to overestimate the density by ca. 4\% and also overestimate the stiffness of chains. The Yoon et al. model is in best agreement with experimental characteristic ratios. Simulation predictions for the structure factor and for the chain-length dependence of the density are in excellent agreement with experiment.},

	abstract = {As a popular tool in exploring free energy landscapes, the metadynamics method has been widely applied to elucidate various chemical or biochemical processes. As deeply discussed by Laio et al. {[J.} Phys. Chem. B 109, 6714 (2005)], the size of the updating Gaussian function is pivotal to the free energy convergence toward the target free energy surface. For instance, a greater Gaussian height can facilitate the quick visit of a conformation region of interest; however, it may lead to a larger error of the calculated free energy surface. In contrast, a lower Gaussian height can guarantee a better resolution of the calculated free energy surface; however, it will take longer time for such a simulation to navigate through the defined conformational region. In order to reconcile such confliction, the authors present a method by implementing the {Wang-Landau} recursion scheme in the metadynamics simulations to adaptively update the height of the unit Gaussian function. As demonstrated in their model studies on both a toy system, and a realistic molecular system treated with the hybrid quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical {(QM/MM)} potential, the present approach can quickly result in more decently converged free energy surfaces, compared with the classical metadynamics simulations employing the fixed Gaussian heights.},

	abstract = {The propensity to form fibril in disease-related proteins is a widely studied phenomenon, but its correlation, if any, with structural characteristics of the associated proteins is not clearly understood. However, the observation has been made that some proteins that readily form amyloid have a significant number of backbone H bonds that are exposed to solvent molecules, suggesting that these regions have a propensity toward protein interaction and aggregation {[Fernandez,} A. \& Scheraga, H. A. (2003) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. {USA} 100, 113-118]. High-resolution x-ray structures of the sheep and human C-terminal prion protein have provided a useful description of surface and partially buried waters. By molecular dynamics simulations, we investigated the structural role of these water molecules. The solvent dynamical behavior on the protein surface reveals significant features about the stability and the potential interactions of the prion protein. The protein presents regions of tightly bound conserved waters that are necessary to hold in place local elements of the fold, as well as regions where the local water is in fast exchange with bulk water. These results are evidenced by a map of the spatial distribution entropy of the solvent around the protein. The particular behavior of the solvent around these regions may be crucial in the folding stability and in terms of aggregation loci.},

First, a chemical similarity search on the Maybridge library was performed using known {NNRTIs} as reference structures. The top-ranked molecules obtained from this procedure plus 26 known {NNRTIs} were then docked into the binding sites of the wild-type reverse transcriptase {(HIV-RT)} and its {K103N} variant {(K103N-RT)} using Glide 3.5. The top-ranked 100 compounds from the docking for both proteins were post-scored with a procedure using molecular mechanics and continuum solvation {(MM-GB/SA).} The validity of the virtual screening protocol was supported by (i) testing of the {MM-GB/SA} procedure, (ii) agreement between predicted and crystallographic binding poses, (iii) recovery of known potent {NNRTIs} at the top of both rankings, and (iv) identification of top-scoring library compounds that are close in structure to recently reported {NNRTI} {HTS} hits. However, purchase and assaying of selected top-scoring compounds from the library failed to yield active {anti-HIV} agents. Nevertheless, the highest-ranked database compound, S10087, was pursued as containing a potentially viable core. Subsequent synthesis and assaying of S10087 analogues proposed by further computational analysis yielded {anti-HIV} agents with {EC50} values as low as 310 {nM.} Thus, with the aid of computational tools, it was possible to evolve a false positive into a true active.},

	volume = {115},
	abstract = {We examine issues involved in applying and interpreting free-energy perturbation {(FEP)} calculations in molecular simulation, with the aim to develop simple heuristics that can guide their use and warn when a result is likely to be inaccurate. We build on the accuracy model developed in the first paper of this series {[N.} Lu and D. A. Kofke, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 7303 (2001)], which emphasized the sign of the entropy difference {(DeltaS)} between the target and reference systems as an essential indicator for the correct implementation of {FEP} calculations: such calculations must be performed in the 'insertion' direction, for which {DeltaS} {\textless}0, or else they are very likely to be systematically incorrect (i.e., inaccurate). We describe here an extended analysis for insertion {FEP} calculations, and identify the group M {exp(DeltaS/k),} where M is the number of independent {FEP} samples taken and k is Boltzmann's constant, as a relevant quantity for characterizing the accuracy of {FEP} result. We find that if M {exp(DeltaS/k)} is of order 100 or larger, then one can expect the {FEP} calculation to yield a result of minimally acceptable accuracy; for a margin of safety a value of 1000 or greater is preferable for this group. Although the {FEP-measured} {DeltaS} is required to apply this heuristic, it is 'safe' in that any inaccuracy in this {DeltaS} will be such that the group M {exp(DeltaS/k)} is even smaller than it is for the true {DeltaS,} and will therefore still warn of an inaccurate result. The analysis is demonstrated for a very wide range of {DeltaS} values, considering a model {FEP} calculation, a hard-sphere insertion calculation, and a diameter-change {FEP} in the {Lennard-Jones} model. We apply the results of this analysis, and earlier work, to consider the question of the optimal number of intermediate stages to use in a staged {FEP} calculation. The analysis shows that, for optimal accuracy, stages should be selected such that the entropy difference per stage satisfies {DeltaS/k=-1;} however, consideration of the precision instead prescribes that {DeltaS/k=-2.} Inasmuch as the precision is the larger concern once accuracy reaches an acceptable level, the latter criterion forms our recommendation for selecting the number of intermediate stages. {(C)} 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

The vibrational spectra indicate that the two arms of the inhibitor sense quite different environments within the hydrophobic pocket. The vibrational relaxation of the two arms are almost equal at 3 ps from model studies. The {2D} {IR} spectra expose a significant distribution of nitrile frequencies that diffuse at equilibrium on ultrafast time scales ranging from hundreds of femtoseconds to tens of picoseconds. The slow spectral diffusion of the cyanovinyl arm of the inhibitor is attributed to its interaction with the backbone and side chains in the hydrophobic tunnel. The results show that the inhibitor cyano modes lose memory of their structural configurations relative to the hydrophobic pocket within tens of picoseconds. The cross-peaks between the two arms of the drug are tentatively attributed to relaxation of the nitrile state with both arms excited.},

The {ABMD} method naturally allows for extensions based on multiple walkers and replica exchange, where different replicas can have different temperatures and/or collective variables.

Taking advantage of the recent simulated scaling method, we formulate a divide-and-conquer sampling strategy to solve this problem so as to robustly improve the sampling efficiency in generalized ensemble simulations. In the present method, the target conformational space sampling enhancement is decomposed to the sampling enhancements of several subconformational regions, and multiple independent {SS} simulations are performed to establish the individual sampling enhancement for each of the subconformational regions; in order to realize the global importance sampling, structure exchanges among these replicas are performed based on the Monte Carlo acceptance/rejection procedure. As demonstrated in our studies, the present divide-and-conquer sampling algorithm, named by us as simulated scaling based variant Hamiltonian replica exchange method, has superior sampling capability so as to possibly play an essential role in dealing with the present bottleneck of generalized ensemble method developments: the system size limitations},

The present paper suggests an alternative but related concept based on statistical mechanics, which allows to attack realistic molecular systems. In a first step, the frequency of conformational changes is characterized in statistical terms leading to the definition of some Markov operator that describes the corresponding transition probabilities within the canonical ensemble. In a second step, a discretization of via hybrid Monte Carlo techniques (based on short term subtrajectories only) is shown to lead to a stochastic matrix . With these theoretical preparations, an identification algorithm for conformations is applicable (to be presented elsewhere). Numerical results for the n-pentane molecule are given and interpreted.},

It should also be useful for the study of complex systems with a rough energy landscape.},

	volume = {129},
	doi = {10.1063/1.2949815},
	abstract = {Recently, accelerated molecular dynamics {(AMD)} technique was generalized to realize essential energy space random walks so that further sampling enhancement and effective localized enhanced sampling could be achieved. This method is especially meaningful when essential coordinates of the target events are not priori known; moreover, the energy space metadynamics method was also introduced so that biasing free energy functions can be robustly generated. Despite the promising features of this method, due to the nonequilibrium nature of the metadynamics recursion, it is challenging to rigorously use the data obtained at the recursion stage to perform equilibrium analysis, such as free energy surface mapping; therefore, a large amount of data ought to be wasted. To resolve such problem so as to further improve simulation convergence, as promised in our original paper, we are reporting an alternate approach: the adaptive-length self-healing {(ALSH)} strategy for {AMD} simulations; this development is based on a recent self-healing umbrella sampling method. Here, the unit simulation length for each self-healing recursion is increasingly updated based on the {Wang-Landau} flattening judgment. When the unit simulation length for each update is long enough, all the following unit simulations naturally run into the equilibrium regime. Thereafter, these unit simulations can serve for the dual purposes of recursion and equilibrium analysis. As demonstrated in our model studies, by applying {ALSH,} both fast recursion and short nonequilibrium data waste can be compromised. As a result, combining all the data obtained from all the unit simulations that are in the equilibrium regime via the weighted histogram analysis method, efficient convergence can be robustly ensured, especially for the purpose of free energy surface mapping.

	shorttitle = {Specificity in molecular design},
	abstract = {Binding specificity is an important consideration in drug design. An effective drug molecule often must bind with high specificity to its intended target in the body; lower specificity implies the possibility of significant binding to unintended partners, which could instigate deleterious side effects. However, if the target is a rapidly mutating agent, a drug that is too specific will quickly lose its efficacy by not binding, well to functional mutants. Therefore, in molecular design, it is crucial to tailor the binding specificity of a drug to the problem at hand. In practice, specificity is often studied on a case-by-case basis, and it is difficult to create general understanding of the determinants of specificity from the union of such available cases. In this work, we undertook a comprehensive, general study of molecular binding with emphasis on understanding the determinants of specificity from a physical standpoint. By extending a theoretical framework grounded in continuum electrostatics and creating an abstracted lattice model that captures key physical aspects of binding interactions, we systematically explored the relationship between a molecule's physical characteristics and its binding specificity toward potential partners. The theory and simulated binding interactions suggested that charged molecules are more specific binders than their hydrophobic counterparts for several reasons. First, the biological spectrum of possible binding characteristics includes more partners that bind equally well to hydrophobic ligands than to charged ligands. Also, charged ligands, whose electrostatic potentials have strong orientational dependence, are more sensitive to shape complementarity than their hydrophobic counterparts. Ligand conformational and orientational flexibility can further influence a charged molecule's ability to bind specifically. Interestingly, we found that conformational flexibility can increase the specificity of polar and charged ligands, by allowing them to greatly lower the binding free energy to a select few partners relative to others. Additionally, factors such as a molecule's size and the ionic strength of the solution were found to predictably affect binding specificity. Taken together, these results, all of which stem from a unified theoretical framework, provide valuable physical insight into the general determinants of binding specificity and promiscuity in a biological environment. The general principles discussed here could prove useful in the design of molecules with tailored specificities, leading to more effective therapeutics.},

One particularly exciting approach is time-resolved electronic circular dichroism {(CD)} spectroscopy, which offers resolution on a nanosecond (or faster) time scale, although it does not provide the spatial resolution of techniques like X-ray crystallography or {NMR.} The thrust of our work is to underpin fast time scale spec- troscopic studies of protein folding with a stronger theoretical foundation. Ultimately, we seek to use molecular dynamics simulations to study the influence of conformational dynamics and conformational transitions on the electronic {CD} spectra of proteins.

We build on the accuracy model developed in the first paper of this series {[N.} Lu and D. A. Kofke, J. Chem. Phys. 114, 7303 (2001)], which emphasized the sign of the entropy difference {(DeltaS)} between the target and reference systems as an essential indicator for the correct implementation of {FEP} calculations: such calculations must be performed in the 'insertion' direction, for which {DeltaS} {\textless}0, or else they are very likely to be systematically incorrect (i.e., inaccurate). We describe here an extended analysis for insertion {FEP} calculations, and identify the group M {exp(DeltaS/k),} where M is the number of independent {FEP} samples taken and k is Boltzmann's constant, as a relevant quantity for characterizing the accuracy of {FEP} result. We find that if M {exp(DeltaS/k)} is of order 100 or larger, then one can expect the {FEP} calculation to yield a result of minimally acceptable accuracy; for a margin of safety a value of 1000 or greater is preferable for this group. Although the {FEP-measured} {DeltaS} is required to apply this heuristic, it is 'safe' in that any inaccuracy in this {DeltaS} will be such that the group M {exp(DeltaS/k)} is even smaller than it is for the true {DeltaS,} and will therefore still warn of an inaccurate result. The analysis is demonstrated for a very wide range of {DeltaS} values, considering a model {FEP} calculation, a hard-sphere insertion calculation, and a diameter-change {FEP} in the {Lennard-Jones} model. We apply the results of this analysis, and earlier work, to consider the question of the optimal number of intermediate stages to use in a staged {FEP} calculation. The analysis shows that, for optimal accuracy, stages should be selected such that the entropy difference per stage satisfies {DeltaS/k=-1;} however, consideration of the precision instead prescribes that {DeltaS/k=-2.} Inasmuch as the precision is the larger concern once accuracy reaches an acceptable level, the latter criterion forms our recommendation for selecting the number of intermediate stages. {(C)} 2001 American Institute of Physics.},

The inhibitors studied represent a severe challenge for explicit free energy calculations. The mutations from one compound to another involve up to 19 atoms, the creation and annihilation of net charge and several alternate binding modes. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain highly converged results ( /- 5-10 {kJ/mol)} even for such complex multi-atom mutations by simulating on a nanosecond time scale. This is achieved by using soft-core potentials to facilitate the creation and deletion of atoms and by a careful choice of mutation pathway.

	abstract = {A modified thermodynamic integration technique is presented to obtain free energy differences from molecular dynamics simulations. In this multiconfiguration thermodynamic integration technique, the commonly employed single configuration (slow growth) approximation is not made. It is shown, by analysis of the sources of error, how the multiconfiguration variant of thermodynamic integration allows for a soundly based assessment of the statistical error in the evaluated free energy difference. Since ensembles of configurations are generated for each integration step, a statistical error can be evaluated for each integration step. By generating ensembles of different lengths, the statistical error can be equally distributed over the integration. This eliminates the difficult problem in single configuration thermodynamic integrations of determining the best rate of change of the Hamiltonian, which is usually based on equally distributing the free energy change. At the same time, this procedure leads to a more efficient use of computer time by providing the possibility of added accuracy from separate calculations of the same leads to a more efficient use of computer time by providing the possibility of added accuracy from separate calculations of the same Hamiltonian change. The technique is applied to a simple but illustrative model system consisting of a monatomic solute in aqueous solution. In a second example, a combination of multiconfiguration thermodynamic integration and thermodynamic perturbation is used to obtain the potentials of mean force for rotation of the sidechain dihedral angles for valine and threonine dipeptides with restrained backbones in aqueous solution.},

Two procedures for disappearing atoms during a single-topology {FEP} are investigated and dramatic differences in free energy convergence behavior are seen. Comparison of these two protocols suggests that the coupling of the removal of angular constraints with the disappearance of an atom may significantly slow free energy convergence. The series of ligands under investigation here cover a range of modifications at the 3-position of 4-([4-(cyclohexyl methoxy)benzyl]aminocarbonyl) phenyl phosphate. Unlike any other compound in this study, the 3-amide analog can form two hydrogen bonds within the region of the perturbation, one to a backbone amide hydrogen and one to a highly coordinated water molecule. Agreement with experimental trends in binding affinity is seen, although the computed relative free energy of binding of the amido compound is underestimated. These results are reconciled by examination of the hydration energies of model systems, which predict primary amides as too hydrophilic.},

	abstract = {We investigated the convergence behavior of potential of mean force {(PMF)} calculations using free energy perturbation {(FEP),} thermodynamic integration {(TI),} and âslow growthâ {(SG)} techniques. The critical comparison of these alternative approaches is illustrated by the study of three different systems: two tagged argon atoms in a periodic box of argon, two methane molecules, and two benzene molecules maintained in a {âT-shapedâ} conformation, both dimers embedded in a periodic box of water. The complete {PMF} simulations were carried out considering several protocols, in which the number of intermediate âlambdaâ states, together with the amount of sampling per individual state, were varied. In most cases, as much as 1 ns of molecular dynamics {(MD)} sampling, was used to derive each free energy profile. For the different systems examined, we find that {FEP} and {TI} unquestionably constitute robust computational methods leading to results of comparable accuracy. We also show that proper convergence of the free energy calculations, and further quantitative interpretation of the {PMFs,} requires total simulation times much higher than has been hitherto estimated. In some circumstances, the free energy profiles derived from {FEP} calculations tend to be slightly poorer than those obtained with {TI,} as a probable consequence of the greater sensitivity of {FEP} to the window spacing delta lambda. Ln the context of {TI,} and to a lesser extent {FEP,} simulations, it appears preferable to employ a limited number of âlambdaâ points of the integrand involving extensive sampling, rather than numerous points with fewer samplings. Finally, we note that, at least in the case of nonpolar interactions, {PMFs} of reasonable quality can be generated using {SG,} and at a substantially lower cost than with either {FEP} or {TI.} {(C)} 1996 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Water molecules play a crucial role in mediating the interaction between a ligand and a macromolecular receptor. An understanding of the nature and role of each water molecule in the active site of a protein could greatly increase the efficiency of rational drug design approaches: if the propensity of a water molecule for displacement can be determined, then synthetic effort may be most profitably applied to the design of specific ligands with the displacement of this water molecule in mind. In this paper, a thermodynamic analysis of water molecules in the binding sites of six proteins, each complexed with a number of inhibitors, is presented. Two classes of water molecules were identified: those conserved and not displaced by any of the ligands, and those that are displaced by some ligands. The absolute binding free energies of 54 water molecules were calculated using the double decoupling method, with replica exchange thermodynamic integration in Monte Carlo simulations. It was found that conserved water molecules are on average more tightly bound than displaced water molecules. In addition, Bayesian statistics is used to calculate the probability that a particular water molecule may be displaced by an appropriately designed ligand, given the calculated binding free energy of the water molecule. This approach therefore allows the numerical assessment of whether or not a given water molecule should be targeted for displacement as part of a rational drug design strategy.},

	abstract = {To understand how a protein folds is a problem which has important biological implications. In this article, we would like to present a physics-oriented point of view, which is twofold. First of all, we introduce simple statistical mechanics models which display, in the thermodynamic limit, folding and related transitions. These models can be divided into (i) crude spin glass-like models (with their Mattis analogs), where one may look for possible correlations between the chain self-interactions and the folded structure, (ii) glass-like models, where one emphasizes the geometrical competition between one- or two-dimensional local order (mimicking alpha helix or beta sheet structures), and the requirement of global compactness. Both models are too simple to predict the spatial organization of a realistic protein, but are useful for the physicist and should have some feedback in other glassy systems (glasses, collapsed polymers,â¯). These remarks lead us to the second physical approach, namely a new {Monte-Carlo} method, where one grows the protein atom-by-atom (or residue-by-residue), using a standard form {(CHARMM,â¯)} for the total energy. A detailed comparison with other {Monte-Carlo} schemes, or Molecular Dynamics calculations, is then possible; we will sketch such a comparison for poly-alanines. Our twofold approach illustrates some of the difficulties one encounters in the protein folding problem, in particular those associated with the existence of a large number of metastable states.},

The first crystal structures of group-1 {NAs} revealed that although the binding pose of oseltamivir was similar to that seen in previous crystallographic complexes, the 150-loop adopted a distinct conformation, opening a new cavity adjacent to the active site. Here we show that the 150-loop is able to open into significantly wider conformations than seen in the crystal structures, through explicitly solvated {MD} simulations of the apo and oseltamivir-bound forms of tetrameric N1.

The process requires discretization of one or more reaction coordinates to generate a histogram from which the continuous probability density is inferred. We show that the finite size of the intervals used to construct the histogram leads to quantifiable systematic error. The width of these intervals also determines the statistical error in the free energy, and the choice of the appropriate interval is therefore driven by the need to balance the two sources of error. We present a method for the construction of the optimal histogram for a given system, and show that the use of this technique requires little additional computational expense. We demonstrate the efficacy of the technique for a model system, and discuss how the principles governing the choice of discretization interval could be used to improve extended sampling techniques.},

	volume = {61},
	abstract = {{GP} catalyzes the phosphorylation of glycogen to {Glc-1-P.} Because of its fundamental role in the metabolism of glycogen, {GP} has been the target for a systematic structure-assisted design of inhibitory compounds, which could be of value in the therapeutic treatment of type 2 diabetes melli- tus. The most potent catalytic-site inhibitor of {GP} identified to date is spirohydantoin of glucopyr- anose (hydan). In this work, we employ {MD} free energy simulations to calculate the relative binding affinities for {GP} of hydan and two spirohydantoin analogues, methyl-hydan and n-hydan, in which a hydrogen atom is replaced by a methyl- or amino group, respectively. The results are compared with the experimental relative affinities of these ligands, estimated by kinetic measurements of the ligand inhibition constants. The calculated binding affin- ity for methyl-hydan (relative to hydan) is 3.75 {\textasciicircum}@ 1.4 kcal/mol, in excellent agreement with the experimental value (3.6 {\textasciicircum}@ 0.2 kcal/mol). For n-hydan, the calculated value is 1.0 {\textasciicircum}@ 1.1 kcal/mol, somewhat smaller than the experimental result (2.3 {\textasciicircum}@ 0.1 kcal/mol). A free energy decomposition analysis shows that hydan makes optimum interactions with protein residues and specific water molecules in the catalytic site. In the other two ligands, structural perturbations of the active site by the additional methyl- or amino group reduce the corresponding binding affinities. The computed binding free energies are sensitive to the preference of a specific water molecule for two well-defined positions in the catalytic site. The behavior of this water is analyzed in detail, and the free energy profile for the translocation of the water between the two positions is evaluated. The results provide insights into the role of water molecules in modulating ligand binding affinities. A comparison of the interactions between a set of ligands and their surrounding groups in X-ray structures is often used in the interpretation of binding free energy differences and in guiding the design of new ligands. For the systems in this work, such an approach fails to estimate the order ofrelative binding strengths, in contrast to the rigorous free energy treatment.},

Using these {lambda-WHAM} generated energy derivative histograms, free energy estimation efficiency and accuracy are optimally improved; more interestingly, with this additional {lambda-WHAM} component, these seemingly different theoretical approaches become identical.

In addition to {Lennard-Jones} sites on carbon atoms, this model utilizes {Lennard-Jones} sites on the centers of carbon-hydrogen bonds. Configurational-bias Monte Carlo simulations in the Gibbs and canonical ensembles were carried out to calculate the one-component vapor-liquid phase equilibria for methane to n-dodecane, to determine the phase diagram of supercritical ethane and n-heptane mixtures, to obtain the Gibbs free energies of transfer for n-pentane and n-hexane between helium vapor and rr-heptane liquid phases, and to study the high-pressure region of the equation of state for n-pentane and n-decane. The explicit-hydrogen representation with its more faithful description of the molecular shape of alkanes allows us to find a set of {Lennard-Jones} parameters that yields significantly better agreement with experiment for one- and multicomponent phase equilibria than our united-atom alkane model, but the price is higher computational cost.},

	abstract = {Abstract: Synthetic receptors have a wide range of potential applications, but it has been difficult to design low molecular weight receptors that bind ligands with high, "proteinlike" affinities. This study uses novel computational methods to understand why it is hard to design a high-affinity receptor and to explore the limits of affinity, with the bioactive peptide {RGD} as a model ligand. The M2 modeling method is found to yield excellent agreement with experiment for a known {RGD} receptor and then is used to analyze a series of receptors generated in silico with a de novo design algorithm. Forces driving binding are found to be systematically opposed by proportionate repulsions due to desolvation and entropy. In particular, strong correlations are found between Coulombic attractions and the electrostatic desolvation penalty and between the mean energy change on binding and the cost in configurational entropy. These correlations help explain why it is hard to achieve high affinity. The change in surface area upon binding is found to correlate poorly with affinity within this series. Measures of receptor efficiency are formulated that summarize how effectively a receptor uses surface area, total energy, and Coulombic energy to achieve affinity. Analysis of the computed efficiencies suggests that a low molecular weight receptor can achieve proteinlike affinity. It is also found that macrocyclization of a receptor can, unexpectedly, increase the entropy cost of binding because the macrocyclic structure further restricts ligand motion.},

We find that the net difference in free energy for the two changes is 0.85 kcal/mol, with the binding of {FK506} relatively more favorable for the native protein than the mutant. This net energy compares very favorably with the experimentally measured value of 0.60 kcal/mol. The results indicate that the relatively better binding of {FK506} to the native protein is driven by the favorable entropy associated with the release of water molecules from the protein when the ligand binds. For a variety of reasons, modest size of the system, smallness of the change being examined, rapid convergence of the ensemble that needs to be determined and use of statistical estimates to control sampling, we have been able to carry out atypically reliable and reproducible free energy calculations for this protein system. Free energy changes for the two simulations {(Y82F} {FKBP-12/FK506} and {Y82F} {FKBP-12)} have been calculated a total of eight times each, to compare a variety of different methodological choices and to ensure that the results are statistically significant. Detailed analysis of the free energy results has been carried out, and indicates that even when applicable, deconvolution of the total free energy into components can be very difficult, that the statistical error estimates can give a reasonable bound on the error in a simulation, and that one must be careful to use the same simulation protocol in all simulations being compared.},

The method can be used for the creation of de novo ligands and for the modification of existing ligands. The binding site is saturated with atoms (sp(3) carbon atoms in the present implementation) that form molecules under the influence of a potential function that joins atoms to each other with the correct stereochemistry. The resulting molecules are linked to precomputed functional gro up minimum energy positions in the binding site, The generalized potential function allows atoms to sample a continuous parameter space that includes the Cartesian coordinates and their occupancy and type, e.g., the method allows change of an sp(3) carbon into an sp(2) carbon or oxygen, A parameter space formulated in this way can then be sampled and optimized by a variety of methods. In this work, molecules are generated by use of a Monte Carlo simulated annealing algorithm, The {DLD} method is illustrated by its application to the binding site of {FK506} binding protein {(FKBP),} an immunophilin. De novo ligands are designed and modification of the immunosuppressant drug {FK506} are suggested, The results demonstrate that the dynamic ligand design approach can automatically construct ligands which complement both the shape and charge distribution of the binding site. {(C)} 1995 {Wiley-Liss,} Inc.},

	abstract = {Following the interest generated by two previous blind tests of crystal structure prediction {(CSP1999} and {CSP2001),} a third such collaborative project {(CSP2004)} was hosted by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. A range of methodologies used in searching for and ranking the likelihood of predicted crystal structures is represented amongst the 18 participating research groups, although most are based on the global minimization of the lattice energy. Initially the participants were given molecular diagrams of three molecules and asked to submit three predictions for the most likely crystal structure of each. Unlike earlier blind tests, no restriction was placed on the possible space group of the target crystal structures. Furthermore, Z' = 2 structures were allowed. Part-way through the test, a partial structure report was discovered for one of the molecules, which could no longer be considered a blind test. Hence, a second molecule from the same category (small, rigid with common atom types) was offered to the participants as a replacement. Success rates within the three submitted predictions were lower than in the previous tests - there was only one successful prediction for any of the three `blind' molecules. For the `simplest' rigid molecule, this lack of success is partly due to the observed structure crystallizing with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. As in the 2001 blind test, there was no success in predicting the structure of the flexible molecule. The results highlight the necessity for better energy models, capable of simultaneously describing conformational and packing energies with high accuracy. There is also a need for improvements in search procedures for crystals with more than one independent molecule, as well as for molecules with conformational flexibility. These are necessary requirements for the prediction of possible thermodynamically favoured polymorphs. Which of these are actually realised is also influenced by as yet insufficiently understood processes of nucleation and crystal growth.},

Secondary structure motifs such as alpha-helices and beta-hairpins can form in 0.1-10 mus (ref. 1), whereas small proteins have been shown to fold completely in tens of microseconds(2). The longest folding simulation to date is a single 1-mus simulation of the villin headpiece(3); however, such single runs may miss many features of the folding process as it is a heterogeneous reaction involving an ensemble of transition states(4,5). Here, we have used a distributed computing implementation to produce tens of thousands of 5-20-ns trajectories (700 mus) to simulate mutants of the designed mini-protein {BBA5.} The fast relaxation dynamics these predict were compared with the results of laser temperature-jump experiments. Our computational predictions are in excellent agreement with the experimentally determined mean folding times and equilibrium constants. The rapid folding of {BBA5} is due to the swift formation of secondary structure. The convergence of experimentally and computationally accessible timescales will allow the comparison of absolute quantities characterizing in vitro and in silico (computed) protein folding(6).},

The free energy perturbation {(FEP)} methodology is the most accurate means of estimating relative binding affinities between two inhibitors. However, due to its complexity and computation-intensive nature, practical applications are restricted to analysis of structurally-related inhibitors. Accordingly, there is a need for methods that enable rapid assessment of a large number of structurally-unrelated molecules in a suitably accurate manner. In this review, the {FEP} method is compared with molecular mechanics {(MM)} methods to assess the advantages of each in the estimation of relative binding affinities of inhibitors to an enzyme. Qualitative predictions of relative binding free energies of fructose 1, 6-bisphosphatase inhibitors using {MM} methods are discussed and compared with the corresponding {FEP} results. The results indicate that the {MM} based methods and the {FEP} method are useful in the qualitative and quantitative assessment of relative binding affinities of enzyme inhibitors, respectively, prior to synthesis.},

	abstract = {A computational model of the non-nucleoside inhibitor {8-Cl} {TIBO} complexed with {HIV-1} reverse transcriptase {(RT)} was constructed in order to determine the binding free energies. Using Monte Carlo simulations, both free energy perturbation and linear response calculations were carried out for the transformation of wild-type {RT} to two key mutants, {Y181C} and {L100I.} The newer linear response method estimates binding free energies based on changes in electrostatic and van der Waals energies and solvent-accessible surface areas. In addition, the change in stability of the protein between the folded and unfolded states was estimated for each of these mutations, which are known to emerge upon treatment with the inhibitor. Results from the calculations revealed that there is a large hydrophobic contribution to protein stability in the native, folded state. The calculated absolute free energies of binding from both the linear response, and also the more rigorous free energy perturbation method, gave excellent agreement with the experimental differences in activity. The success of the relatively rapid linear response method in predicting experimental activities holds promise for estimating the activity of the inhibitors not only against the wild-type {RT,} but also against key protein variants whose emergence undermines the efficacy of the drugs.},

Application of lambda-dynamics to this system gives a reasonable estimate of the binding affinity of the ligands. This methodology also provides a means to explore the binding orientations and conformations of the ligands inside the binding pocket much better than does conventional {MD.} This is due to the scaling of forces inherent in the it-dynamics method, which lowers the barriers separating different binding modes and conformations. Examination of the lambda-dynamics trajectory of the ligands revealed alternative binding orientations and conformations not detected by crystallography. Furthermore, a lambda-dynamics simulation starting from random initial orientations, in which some li,ligands take significantly different orientations as compared with those from the X-ray structure, successfully samples the X-ray crystallographic orientations in all ligands. Ligand sampling by conventional {MD} starting from same initial structures remains trapped in the local minima from which they start. Such efficient sampling of ligand orientations and conformations is expected to diminish the limitation that an initial ligand structure must be close to its true bound orientation in order to yield a reasonable estimate of the binding free energy.},

Analysis of these transition functions for signatures of Markovian behavior is described. The method has been applied to an example problem that is based on an underlying Markov process. The example problem shows that when an instance of the process is analyzed under the assumption that the underlying states have been aggregated into macrostates, a procedure known as lumping, the resulting chain appears to have been produced by a {non-Markovian} process when viewed at high temporal resolution. However, when viewed on longer time scales, and for appropriately lumped macrostates, Markovian behavior can be recovered. The potential for extracting the long time scale behavior of the folding process from a large number of short, independent molecular dynamics simulations is also explored.},

	volume = {25},
	abstract = {A challenge in free energy calculation for complex molecular systems by computer simulation is to obtain a reliable estimate within feasible computational time. In this study, we suggest an answer to this challenge by exploring a simple method, overlap sampling {(OS),} for producing reliable free-energy results in an efficient way. The formalism of the {OS} method is based on ensuring sampling of important overlapping phase space during perturbation calculations. This technique samples both forward and reverse free energy perturbation {(FEP)} to improve the free-energy calculation. It considers the asymmetry of the {FEP} calculation and features an ability to optimize both the precision and the accuracy of the measurement without affecting the simulation process itself. The {OS} method is tested at two optimization levels: no optimization (simple {OS),} and full optimization (equivalent to Bennett's method), and compared to conventional {FEP} techniques, including the widely used direct {FEP} averaging method, on three alchemical mutation systems: (a) an anion transformation in water solution, (b) mutation between methanol and ethane, and (c) alchemical change of an adenosine molecule. It is consistently shown that the reliability of free-energy estimates can be greatly improved using the {OS} techniques at both optimization levels, while the performance of Bennett's method is particularly striking. In addition, the efficiency of a calculation can be significantly improved because the method is able to (a) converge to the right answer quickly, and (b) work for large perturbations. The basic two-stage {OS} method can be extended to admit additional stages, if needed. We suggest that the {OS} method can be used as a general perturbation technique for computing free energy differences in molecular simulations.},

	abstract = {Variable selection is fundamental to high-dimensional statistical modeling, including nonparametric regression. Many approaches in use are stepwise selection procedures, which can be computationally expensive and ignore stochastic errors in the variable selection process. In this article, penalized likelihood approaches are proposed to handle these kinds of problems. The proposed methods select variables and estimate coefficients simultaneously. Hence they enable us to construct confidence intervals for estimated parameters. The proposed approaches are distinguished from others in that the penalty functions are symmetric, nonconcave on (0, infinity), and have singularities at the origin to produce sparse solutions. Furthermore, the penalty functions should be bounded by a constant to reduce bias and satisfy certain conditions to yield continuous solutions. A new algorithm is proposed for optimizing penalized likelihood functions. The proposed ideas are widely applicable. They are readily applied to a variety of parametric models such as generalized linear models and robust regression models. They can also be applied easily to nonparametric modeling by using wavelets and splines. Rates of convergence of the proposed penalized likelihood estimators are established. Furthermore, with proper choice of regularization parameters, we show that the proposed estimators perform as well as the oracle procedure in variable selection; namely, they work as well as if the correct submodel were known. Our simulation shows that the newly proposed methods compare favorably with other variable selection techniques. Furthermore. the standard error formulas are tested to be accurate enough for practical applications.},

This sometimes can be achieved only by careful design of the transition kernel of the chain, on the basis of a detailed preliminary exploratory analysis of Ï. An alternative approach might be to allow the transition kernel to adapt whenever new features of Ï are encountered during the {MCMC} run. However, if such adaptation occurs infinitely often, then the stationary distribution of the chain may be disturbed. We describe a framework, based on the concept of Markov chain regeneration, which allows adaptation to occur infinitely often but does not disturb the stationary distribution of the chain or the consistency of sample path averages.},

We have investigated several possible approaches to extend one-step perturbation methods to also obtain accurate solvation free energies of polar species. A soft dipole reference state permits the determination of accurate relative solvation free energies for polar solutes (average unsigned error {\textless} 2.0 {kJ/mol)} but does not yield accurate absolute solvation free energies. However, contrary to expectations, simulations of a neutral reference state even yield accurate (average unsigned error {\textless} 2.9 {kJ/mol)} absolute solvation free energies for polar solutes when translational and rotational sampling of the solute is included. In general, the choice of an appropriate reference state for one-step perturbation is a challenge because of complex many-body effects. Nonetheless, the one-step perturbation method combined with an unphysical reference state yields accurate free energy estimates with an efficiency several times greater than traditional approaches.},

	abstract = {We have extended and applied a multicoordinate free energy method, chemical Monte {Carlo/Molecular} Dynamics {(CMC/MD),} to calculate the relative free energies of different amino acid side-chains. {CMC/MD} allows the calculation of the relative free energies for many chemical species from a single free energy calculation. We have previously shown its utility in host:guest chemistry {(Pitera} and Kollman, J Am Chem Soc 1998;120:7557-7567) and ligand design {(Eriksson} et al., J Med Chem 1999;42:868-881), and here demonstrate its utility in calculations of amino acid properties and protein stability. We first study the relative solvation free energies of N-methylated and acetylated alanine, valine, and serine amino acids. With careful inclusion of rotameric states, internal energies, and both the solution and vacuum states of the calculation, we calculate relative solvation free energies in good agreement with thermodynamic integration {(TI)} calculations. Interestingly, we find that a significant amount of the unfavorable solvation of valine seen in prior work {(Sun} et al., J Am Chem Soc 1992;114:6798-6801) is caused by restraining the backbone in an extended conformation. In contrast, the solvation free energy of serine is calculated to be less favorable than expected from experiment, due to the formation of a favorable intramolecular hydrogen bond in the vacuum state. These monomer calculations emphasize the need to accurately consider all significant conformations of flexible molecules in free energy calculations. This development of the {CMC/MD} method paves the way for computations of protein stability analogous to the biochemical technique of ldquoexhaustive mutagenesis.rdquo We have carried out just such a calculation at position 133 of T4 lysozyme, where we use {CMC/MD} to calculate the relative stability of eight different side-chain mutants in a single free energy calculation. Our T4 calculations show good agreement with the prior free energy calculations of Veenstra et al. {(Prot} Eng 1997;10:789-807) and excellent agreement with the experiments of Mendel et al. {(Science} 1992;256:1798-1802).

	abstract = {Motivation: Accurate predictive models for the impact of single amino acid substitutions on protein stability provide insight into protein structure and function. Such models are also valuable for the design and engineering of new proteins. Previously described methods have utilized properties of protein sequence or structure to predict the free energy change of mutants due to thermal {({Delta}{Delta}G)} and denaturant {({Delta}{Delta}GH2O)} denaturations, as well as mutant thermal stability {({Delta}Tm),} through the application of either computational energy-based approaches or machine learning techniques. However, accuracy associated with applying these methods separately is frequently far from optimal. Results: We detail a computational mutagenesis technique based on a four-body, knowledge-based, statistical contact potential. For any mutation due to a single amino acid replacement in a protein, the method provides an empirical normalized measure of the ensuing environmental perturbation occurring at every residue position. A feature vector is generated for the mutant by considering perturbations at the mutated position and it's ordered six nearest neighbors in the 3-dimensional {(3D)} protein structure. These predictors of stability change are evaluated by applying machine learning tools to large training sets of mutants derived from diverse proteins that have been experimentally studied and described. Predictive models based on our combined approach are either comparable to, or in many cases significantly outperform, previously published results.

The {OS} method has a sound theoretical basis to address the free energy of cavity formation, whereas the {LIE} approach is more versatile and efficient to calculate the free energy of adding charges to such cavities. The off-term, which is neglected in the original {LIE} equation, can be calculated without additional costs from the {OS,} offering a powerful synergy between the two methods. The {LIE/OS} approach presented here combines the best of two worlds and for the model systems studied here, is more accurate than and as efficient as the original methods. It has a sound theoretical background and no longer requires any empirical parameters.

The results are compared to the best empirical scoring function, selected from a set of 10 scoring functions. In all cases, good {LIE} models can be obtained in terms of free-energy {RMS} errors, although reasonable ranking of the ligands of dihydrofolate reductase proves difficult for both the {LIE} method and scoring functions. For the other proteins, the {LIE} model results in better predictions than the best performing scoring function.

Depending on the choice of reference compound, relative free energies of binding rigid ligands to the ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor can be obtained that show good agreement with the experimental values. The approach presented here can easily be applied to many rigid ligands, and it should be relatively easy to extend the method to account for ligand flexibility.

	doi = {10.1021/jp809641j},
	abstract = {Hydrogen bonds play an important role in stabilizing (meta-)stable states in protein folding. Hence, they can potentially be used as a way to bias these states in molecular simulation methods. Previously, Wolf et al. showed that applying repulsive and attractive hydrogen bond biasing potentials in an alternating way significantly accelerates the folding process {(Wolf,} M. G.; de Leeuw, S. W. Biophys. J. 2008, 94, 3742). As the biasing potentials are only active during a fixed time interval, this alternating scheme does not represent a thermodynamic equilibrium. In this work, we present a Hamiltonian replica exchange molecular dynamics {(REMD)} scheme that aims to shuffle and reorder hydrogen bonds in the protein backbone. We therefore apply adapted hydrogen bond potentials in a Hamiltonian {REMD} scheme, which we call hydrogen bond switching {(HS).} To compare the performance of the {HS} to a standard {REMD} method, we performed {HS} and temperature {REMD} simulations of a Î²-heptapeptide in methanol. Both methods sample the conformational space to a similar extent. As the {HS} simulation required only five replicas, while the {REMD} simulation required 20 replicas, the {HS} method is significantly more efficient. We tested the {HS} method also on a larger system, 16-residue polyalanine in water. Both of the simulations starting from a completely unfolded and a folded conformation resulted in an ensemble with, apart from the starting structure, similar conformational minima. We can conclude that the {HS} method provides an efficient way to sample the conformational space of a protein, without requiring knowledge of the folded states beforehand. In addition, these simulations revealed that convergence was hampered by replicas having a preference for specific biasing potentials. As this sorting effect is inherent to any Hamiltonian {REMD} method, finding a solution will result in an additional increase in the efficiency of Hamiltonian {REMD} methods in general.},

These interactions describe the energetics of all possible configurations of the same alloy, which can hence be readily used to identify ground state structures and, through statistical mechanics solutions, find finite-temperature properties. In practice, the biggest challenge is to identify the types of interactions which are most important for a given alloy out of the many possibilities. We describe a genetic algorithm which automates this task. To avoid a possible trapping in a locally optimal interaction set, we periodically âlock outâ persistent near-optimal cluster expansions. In this way, we identify not only the best possible combination of interaction types but also any near-optimal cluster expansions. Our strategy is not restricted to the cluster expansion method alone, and can be applied to select the qualitative parameter types of any other class of complex model Hamiltonians.},

Therefore, an accurate estimate of the relative free energy can be obtained by construction. The authors applied the method to four test systems (dipole inversion, van der Waals interaction perturbation, charge inversion, and water to methanol conversion) and compared the results to thermodynamic integration estimates. In two cases, the enveloping distribution sampling calculation was straightforward. However, in the charge inversion and the water to methanol conversion, Hamiltonian replica-exchange molecular dynamics of the reference state was necessary to observe transitions in the reference state simulation between the parts of phase space important to A and B, respectively. This can be explained by the total absence of phase space overlap of A and B in these two cases. (c) 2007 American Institute of Physics.},

	abstract = {Limited searching in the conformational space is one of the major obstacles for investigating protein dynamics by numerical approaches. For this reason, classical all-atom molecular dynamics {(MD)} simulations of proteins tend to be confined to local energy minima, particularly when the bulk solvent is treated explicitly. To overcome this problem, we have developed a novel replica exchange protocol that uses modified force-field parameters to treat interparticle nonbonded potentials within the protein and between protein and solvent atoms, leaving unperturbed those relative to solventsolvent interactions. We have tested the new protocol on the 18-residue-long tip of the P domain of calreticulin in an explicit solvent. With only eight replicas, we have been able to considerably enhance the conformational space sampled during a 100 ns simulation, compared to as many parallel classical molecular dynamics simulations of the same length or to a single one lasting 450 ns. A direct comparison between the various simulations has been possible thanks to the implementation of the weighted histogram analysis method, by which conformations simulated with modified force-field parameters can be assigned different weights. Interatom, inter-residue distances in the structural ensembles obtained with our novel replica exchange approach and by classical {MD} simulations compare equally well with those derived from {NMR} data. Rare events, such as unfolding and refolding, occur with reasonable statistical frequency. Visiting of conformations characterized by very small Boltzmann weights is also possible. Despite their low probability, such regions of the conformational space may play an important role in the search for local potential-energy minima and in dynamically controlled functions.},

	doi = {10.1021/jp9605212},
	abstract = {We have investigated the feasibility of predicting free energy differences between a manifold of molecular states from a single simulation or ensemble representing one reference state. Two formulas that are based on the so-called lambda- coupling parameter approach are analyzed and compared: (i) expansion of the free energy F(lambda) into a Taylor series around a reference state (lambda = 0), and (ii) the so-called free energy perturbation formula. The results obtained by these extrapolation methods are compared to exact (target) values calculated by thermodynamic integration for mutations in two molecular systems: a model dipolar diatomic molecule in water, and a series of para-substituted phenols in water. For moderate charge redistribution (0.5 e), both extrapolation methods reproduce the exact free energy differences. For free energy changes due to a change of atom type or size, the Taylor expansion method fails completely, while the perturbation formula yields moderately accurate predictions. Both extrapolation methods fail when a mutation involves the creation or deletion of atoms, due to the poor sampling in the reference state simulation of the configurations that are important in the end states of interest. To overcome this sampling difficulty, a procedure based on the perturbation formula and on biasing the sampling in the reference state is proposed, in which soft-core interaction sites are incorporated into the Hamiltonian of the reference state at positions where atoms are to be created or deleted. For mutations going from p-methylphenol to the other five differently para-substituted phenols, the differences in free energy are correctly predicted using extrapolation based on a single simulation of a biased, non-physical reference state. Since a large number of mutations can be investigated using a recorded trajectory of a single simulation, the proposed method is potentially viable in practical applications such as drug design.},

	abstract = {When estimating binding affinities of a ligand, which can exists in multiple forms, for a target molecule, one must consider all possible competing equilibria. Here, a method is presented that estimates the contribution of the protonation equilibria of a ligand in solution to the measured or calculated binding affinity. The method yields a correction to binding constants that are based on the total concentration of inhibitor (the sum of all ionized forms of the inhibitor in solution) to account for the complexed form of the inhibitor only. The method is applied to the calculation of the difference in binding affinity of two inhibitors, 2-phosphoglycolate {(PGA)} and its phoshonate analog 3-phosphonopropionate {(3PP),} for the glycolytic enzyme triosephosphate isomerase. Both inhibitors have three titrating sites and exist in solution as a mixture of different forms. In this case the form that actually binds to the enzyme is present at relative low concentrations. The contributions of the alternative forms to the difference in binding energies is estimated by means of molecular dynamics simulations and corrections. The inhibitors undergo a {pKa} shift upon binding that is estimated by ab initio calculations. An interesting finding is that the affinity difference of the two inhibitors is not due to different interactions in the active site of the enzyme, but rather due to the difference in the solvation properties of the inhibitors.

	abstract = {Chemical space whether defined by small molecules or large proteins is larger than can be usefully explored. One of the challenges of drug discovery is thus the definition of the overlap between chemical space, biologically useful space and pharmacological space and how this may be employed in the discovery of new small molecule drugs. Despite the decrease in drug discovery productivity in recent years there is no shortage of targets for small molecule intervention, including stroke, pain, neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation and bacterial and viral infections.
Only an extremely small fraction of available chemical space has thus far been explored and it is likely that prior synthetic constraints and bias to existing frameworks and scaffolds have contributed to this. Several approaches are being employed to explore more fruitful paths to discovery. These include recognition that existing therapeutic entities already occupy validated pharmacological space and thus are good leads, the use of molecular fragments that permits a broader exploration of chemical space, and the role of templates that permit fragments to combine to generate active species. Finally, a new focus on natural product-like scaffolds from both synthetic methodologies and the genetic reengineering of biosynthetic pathways is likely to prove valuable.
However the exploration of chemical space will alone not solve the current deficit in drug discovery productivity. It is necessary to recognize that cellular environments are not the dilute homogeneous solutions of many screening systems and that a more integrated systems approach will serve to maximize any success of chemical space exploration.},

	abstract = {An increasing number of studies have reported computations of the standard (absolute) binding free energy of small ligands to proteins using molecular dynamics {(MD)} simulations and explicit solvent molecules that are in good agreement with experiments. This encouraging progress suggests that physics-based approaches hold the promise of making important contributions to the process of drug discovery and optimization in the near future. Two types of approaches are principally used to compute binding free energies with {MD} simulations. The most widely known is the alchemical double decoupling method, in which the interaction of the ligand with its surroundings are progressively switched off. It is also possible to use a potential of mean force {(PMF)} method, in which the ligand is physically separated from the protein receptor. For both of these computational approaches, restraining potentials may be activated and released during the simulation for sampling efficiently the changes in translational, rotational, and conformational freedom of the ligand and protein upon binding. Because such restraining potentials add bias to the simulations, it is important that their effects be rigorously removed to yield a binding free energy that is properly unbiased with respect to the standard state. A review of recent results is presented, and differences in computational methods are discussed. Examples of computations with T4-lysozyme mutants, {FKBP12,} {SH2} domain, and cytochrome P450 are discussed and compared. Remaining difficulties and challenges are highlighted.},

Computer-aided drug design methods have become value-adding disciplines that now contribute to the early stage of the drug discovery process [1, 2]. Computational methods encompass all aspects of drug discovery from target assessment to lead optimization. The computational strategy varies from case to case and can be influenced by several situational variables: lead hunting or lead optimization, requirement for a novel lead class, type of biological assay, structural information available, known classes of ligands, allocated chemistry resources. Today, drug discovery is still a complex and approximate science. Thus, incorporating knowledge-based approaches like ligand-based screenings may bias the process towards success.

This complex process, which is largely based on trial and error, is risk-, time- and cost-intensive. Computational (virtual) screening of drug-like compounds simultaneously against the atomic structures of multiple protein targets, taking into account protein-inhibitor dynamics, might help to identify lead inhibitors more efficiently, particularly for complex drug-resistant diseases. Here we discuss the potential benefits of this approach, using {HIV-1} and Plasmodium falciparum infections as examples. We propose a virtual drug discovery 'pipeline' that will not only identify lead inhibitors efficiently, but also help minimize side-effects and toxicity, thereby increasing the likelihood of successful therapies.},

The main thesis of this article, how-ever,is that there is a disconnect between research in simulation optimization--which has addressed the stochastic nature of discrete-event simulation by concentratingon theoretical results of convergence and specialized algorithms that are mathematically elegant--and the recent software developments, which implement very general algorithms adopted from techniques in the deterministic optimization metaheuristic literature (e.g., genetic algorithms, tabu search, artificial neural networks).

In the case of all approved agents the time frame has been extended to include the 251/2 years from 01/1981 to 06/2006 for all diseases worldwide and from 1950 (earliest so far identified) to 06/2006 for all approved antitumor drugs worldwide. We have continued to utilize our secondary subdivision of a natural product mimic or {NM} to join the original primary divisions. From the data presented, the utility of natural products as sources of novel structures, but not necessarily the final drug entity, is still alive and well. Thus, in the area of cancer, over the time frame from around the 1940s to date, of the 155 small molecules, 73\% are other than S (synthetic), with 47\% actually being either natural products or directly derived therefrom. In other areas, the influence of natural product structures is quite marked, with, as expected from prior information, the antiinfective area being dependent on natural products and their structures. Although combinatorial chemistry techniques have succeeded as methods of optimizing structures and have, in fact, been used in the optimization of many recently approved agents, we are able to identify only one de novo combinatorial compound approved as a drug in this 25 plus year time frame. We wish to draw the attention of readers to the rapidly evolving recognition that a significant number of natural product drugs/leads are actually produced by microbes and/or microbial interactions with the host from whence it was isolated, and therefore we consider that this area of natural product research should be expanded significantly.},

Force field parameters are often developed for, tested with, and applied to a relatively limited range property types. Methods that are able to predict a broad range of properties may be more useful for practical application in an industrial setting. To address this primary goal, entrants were challenged to develop new intermolecular potential models for ethylene oxide {(EO)} and to us they predict a variety of physical properties. The predictions were judged by comparison to a set of benchmark values established based on peer-reviewed scientific literature and highly regarded property databases, and the results were generally excellent. A secondary objective was to assess the variability of those property predictions when performed by different researchers using the same force field (a "round-robin" experiment). To address this goal, entrants were challenged to calculate the same set of properties for a specific {EO} potential model from the literature, and good consistency was found between the predictions of most of the entrants.},

	abstract = {Abstract  This paper focuses on the performance evaluation of complex man-made systems, such as assembly lines, electric power grid,
traffic systems, and various paper processing bureaucracies, etc. For such problems, applying the traditional optimization
tool of mathematical programming and gradient descent procedures of continuous variables optimization are often inappropriate
or infeasible, as the design variables are usually discrete and the accurate evaluation of the system performance via a simulation
model can take too much calculation. General search type and heuristic methods are the only two methods to tackle the problems.
However, the âgoodnessâ of heuristic methods is generally difficult to quantify while search methods often involve extensive
evaluation of systems at many design choices in a large search space using a simulation model resulting in an infeasible computation
burden. The purpose of this paper is to address these difficulties simultaneously by extending the recently developed methodology
of Ordinal Optimization {(OO).} Uniform samples are taken out from the whole search space and evaluated with a crude but computationally
easy model when applying {OO.} And, we argue, after ordering via the crude performance estimates, that the lined-up uniform
samples can be seen as an approximate ruler. By comparing the heuristic design with such a ruler, we can quantify the heuristic
design, just as we measure the length of an object with a ruler. In a previous paper we showed how to quantify a heuristic
design for a special case but we did not have the {OO} ruler idea at that time. In this paper we propose the {OO} ruler idea and
extend the quantifying method to the general case and the multiple independent results case. Experimental results of applying
the ruler are also given to illustrate the utility of this approach.},

	abstract = {The evaluation of performance of a design for complex discrete event systems through simulation is usually very time consuming. Optimizing the system performance becomes even more computationally infeasible. Ordinal optimization {(OO)} is a technique introduced to attack this difficulty in system design by looking at "order" in performances among designs instead of "value" and providing a probability guarantee for a good enough solution instead of the best for sure. The selection rule, known as the rule to decide which subset of designs to select as the {OO} solution, is a key step in applying the {OO} method. Pairwise elimination and round robin comparison are two selection rule examples. Many other selection rules are also frequently used in the ordinal optimization literature. To compare selection rules, we first identify some general facts about selection rules. Then we use regression functions to quantify the efficiency of a group of selection rules, including some frequently used rules. A procedure to predict good selection rules is proposed and verified by simulation and by examples. Selection rules that work well most of the time are recommended.},

	abstract = {Discrete event simulation systems {(DESS)} are widely used in many diverse areas such as computer-communication networks, flexible manufacturing systems, project evaluation and review techniques {(PERT),} and flow networks. Because of their complexity, such systems are typically analyzed via Monte Carlo simulation methods. This paper deals with optimization of complex computer simulation models involving rare events. A classic example is to find an optimal (s, S) policy in a multi-item, multicommodity inventory system, when quality standards require the backlog probability to be extremely small. Our approach is based on change of the probability measure techniques, also called likelihood ratio {(LR)} and importance sampling {(IS)} methods. Unfortunately, for arbitrary probability measures the {LR} estimators and the resulting optimal solution often tend to be unstable and may have large variances. Therefore, the choice of the corresponding importance sampling distribution and in particular its parameters in an optimal way is an important task. We consider the case where the {IS} distribution comes from the same parametric family as the original (true) one and use the stochastic counterpart method to handle simulation based optimization models. More specifically, we use a two-stage procedure: at the first stage we identify (estimate) the optimal parameter vector at the {IS} distribution, while at the second stage we estimate the optimal solution of the underlying constrained optimization problem. Particular emphasis will be placed on estimation of rare events and on integration of the associated performance function into stochastic optimization programs. Supporting numerical results are provided as well.},

Both solutesolvent electrostatic and van der Waals interactions are fully included, and solvent packing is taken into account. The approach is illustrated by calculating the average oxygen and hydrogen density of liquid water around two molecular solutes: water and N-methylacetamide. Molecular dynamics simulations are performed to test the results obtained from the integral equation. It is observed that important microscopic structural features of the average water density due to hydrogen bonding are reproduced by the integral equation.

	abstract = {The solvation free energy of polar and nonpolar molecules in water is examined using the statistical mechanical integral equation theory which was recently introduced by Beglov and Roux {(J.} Phys. Chem. 1997, 101, 7821). The integral equation is an extension of previous theories based on the reference interaction site model {(RISM)} and the hypernetted chain equation {(HNC)} to determine the one-dimensional sitesite radial pair correlation functions. Since the integral equation provides the average density of the solvent interaction sites in three-dimensional (3d) space around a complex molecular solute of arbitrary shape, it is thereby referred to as the {3d-RISM-HNC} integral equation. In the present paper, the accuracy of the {3d-RISM-HNC} integral equation is examined by comparing the calculated excess solvation free energy at infinite dilution with experimental data for a set of nonpolar (n-alkanes) and polar (n-alcohols, n-carboxylic acids, and simple amides) molecules. Thermodynamic integration is used to calculate the excess solvation free energy on the basis of the average site densities obtained by the {3d-RISM-HNC} equation. Two extensions were made to improve the accuracy of the integral equation. First, the susceptibility of pure liquid water (an input for calculating the excess solvation free energy of molecules in the infinite dilution limit) was obtained by combining information from a molecular dynamics simulation with the {RISM-HNC} integral equation. Second, empirical water hydrogen and water oxygen bridge functions were introduced and optimized for improving the accuracy of the theory. The calculated solvation free energies are in good accord with experimental data, although further work will be required for quantitatively accurate results. These preliminary results indicate that the {3d-RISM-HNC} equation with well-calibrated optimized bridge functions is a promising approach for calculating the hydration free energy of complex molecules.},

We find, first, good general agreement between the simulations and the experiments, with an rms error of 1.24 kcal/mol over the whole set (i.e., about 2 {kT)} and a correlation coefficient of 0.89. Second, we use an automated procedure to identify systematic errors for some classes of compounds and suggest some improvements to the force field. We find that alkyne hydration free energies are particularly poorly predicted due to problems with a {Lennard-Jones} well depth and find that an alternate choice for this well depth largely rectifies the situation. Third, we study the nonpolar component of hydration free energiesî¸that is, the part that is not due to electrostatics. While we find that repulsive and attractive components of the nonpolar part both scale roughly with surface area (or volume) of the solute, the total nonpolar free energy does not scale with the solute surface area or volume, because it is a small difference between large components and is dominated by the deviations from the trend. While the methods used here are not new, this is a more extensive test than previous explicit solvent studies, and the size of the test set allows identification of systematic problems with force field parameters for particular classes of compounds. We believe that the computed free energies and components will be valuable to others in the future development of force fields and solvation models.},

Here we apply alchemical free energy calculations in explicit solvent to predict ligand binding in a model cavity in T4 lysozyme. Even in this simple site, there are challenges. We made systematic improvements, beginning with single poses from docking, then including multiple poses, additional protein conformational changes, and using an improved charge model. Computed absolute binding free energies had an {RMS} error of 1.9 kcal/mol relative to previously determined experimental values. In blind prospective tests, the methods correctly discriminated between several true ligands and decoys in a set of putative binders identified by docking. In these prospective tests, the {RMS} error in predicted binding free energies relative to those subsequently determined experimentally was only 0.6 kcal/mol. X-ray crystal structures of the new ligands bound in the cavity corresponded closely to predictions from the free energy calculations, but sometimes differed from those predicted by docking. Finally, we examined the impact of holding the protein rigid, as in docking, with a view to learning how approximations made in docking affect accuracy and how they may be improved.},

	abstract = {Calculations of the binding free energy of various nonpolar aromatic ligands with the {L99A} mutant of T4 lysozyme using molecular dynamics {(MD)} simulation are presented. To ensure better convergence, biasing potentials are used to restrain the ligand orientation and center-of-mass movement relative to the binding site when the ligand is decoupled from its environment in the binding pocket. The bias introduced by the restraint potentials is removed once the ligand fully interacts with the rest of the system and the calculated binding free energy is independent of the applied restraints. To decrease the computational cost, the simulations are generated with a reduced system in which protein and water atoms within a 15 A-radius sphere around the ligand are included explicitly, while the rest of the system is treated with the generalized solvent boundary potential {(GSBP).} For all the ligands, the precision of the calculated free energy is less than 0.5 kcal/mol. For small nonpolar ligands such as benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene, the calculated binding free energies are within 1.1 kcal/mol of the experimental values. For larger ligands, the computed binding free energies are slightly more favorable than the experimental values. The nonbinding polar molecule, phenol, has a calculated binding free energy of 0.88 kcal/mol. The simulation protocol presented here provides a way to calculate the binding free energy of small molecules to receptors at moderate computational cost.},

Selecting the best method for a given task requires deep understanding of their similarities and differences and a systematic approach to method selection. This paper presents a common framework for gaining insight into neural and statistical modeling methods. The framework is then used to unify methods that combine inputs by linear projection before applying the basis function. The result of this unification is a new method called nonlinear continuum regression {(NLCR)} that unifies ordinary least squares regression {(OLS),} partial least squares regression {(PLS),} principal components regression {(PCR)} and ridge regression {(RR),} and nonlinear methods such as, backpropagation networks {(BPN)} with a single hidden layer, projection pursuit regression {(PPR),} nonlinear partial least squares regression {(NLPLS),} and nonlinear principal component regression {(NLPCR),} by spanning the continuum between these methods. The unification is facilitated by developing a common objective function for all methods in this category, and an efficient hierarchical training algorithm, illustrative examples on synthetic data and materials structure-property prediction demonstrate the ability of {NLCR} to specialize to the best existing method based on linear projection, or to a method between existing methods, resulting in the most general model from this class of methods.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel fuzzy logic controller, called
linguistic hedge fuzzy logic controller, to simplify the membership
function constructions and the rule developments. The design methodology
of linguistic hedge fuzzy logic controller is a hybrid model based on
the concepts of the linguistic hedges and the genetic algorithms. The
linguistic hedge operators are used to adjust the shape of the system
membership functions dynamically, and ran speed up the control result to
fit the system demand. The genetic algorithms are adopted to search the
optimal linguistic hedge combination in the linguistic hedge module,
According to the proposed methodology, the linguistic hedge fuzzy logic
controller has the following advantages: 1) it needs only the
simple-shape membership functions rather than the carefully designed
ones for characterizing the related variables; 2) it is sufficient to
adopt a fewer number of rules for inference; 3) the rules are developed
intuitionally without heavily depending on the endeavor of experts; 4)
the linguistic hedge module associated with the genetic algorithm
enables it to be adaptive; 5) it performs better than the conventional
fuzzy logic controllers do; and 6) it can be realized with low design
complexity and small hardware overhead. Furthermore, the proposed
approach has been applied to design three well-known nonlinear systems.
The simulation and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
this design,},

In this work, we build upon previous study and application of a four-state model to the effect of salt concentration on the adsorption and unfolding of the model protein alpha-lactalbumin in {HIC.} Contributions to the apparent adsorption strength of the wild-type protein from native and unfolded conformations, obtained using a deuterium labeling technique, reveal the free energy change and kinetics of unfolding on the resin, and demonstrate that surface unfolding is reversible. Additionally, variants of alpha-lactalbumin in which one of the disulfide bonds is reduced were synthesized to examine the effects of conformational stability on apparent retention. Below the melting temperatures of the wild-type protein and variants, reduction of a single disulfide bond significantly increases the apparent adsorption strength (sim6-8 {kJ/mol)} due to increased instability of the protein. Finally, the four-state model is used to accurately predict the apparent adsorption strength of a disulfide bond-reduced variant. Biotechnol.

	doi = {10.1021/jp0217839},
	abstract = {The computation of absolute binding affinities by molecular dynamics {(MD)} based free energy simulations is analyzed, and an exact method to carry out such a computation is presented. The key to obtaining converged results is the introduction of suitable, auxiliary restraints to prevent the ligand from leaving the binding site when the native ligandreceptor interactions are turned off alchemically. We describe a versatile set of restraints that (i) can be used in {MD} simulations, that (ii) restricts both the position and the orientation of the ligand, and that (iii) is defined relative to the receptor rather than relative to a fixed point in space. The free energy cost, {DeltaAr,} for this set of restraints can be evaluated analytically. Although the techniques were originally developed for the gas phase, the resulting expression is exact, since all contributions from solutesolvent interactions cancel from the final result. The value of {DeltaAr} depends only on the equilibrium values and force constants of the chosen harmonic restraint terms and, therefore, can be easily calculated. The standard state dependence of binding free energies is also investigated, and it is shown that the present approach takes this into account correctly. The analytical expression for {DeltaAr} is verified numerically by calculations on the complex formed by benzene with the {L99A} mutant of T4 lysozyme. The overall approach is illustrated by a complete binding free energy calculation for a complex based on a simplified model for tyrosine bound to {tyrosyl-tRNA-synthetase.} The results demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed set of restraints and confirm that the calculated binding free energy is independent of the details of the restraints. Comparisons are made with earlier formulations for the calculation of binding free energies, and certain limitations of that work are described. The relationship between {DeltaAr} and the loss of translational and rotational entropy during a binding process is analyzed.},

	abstract = {Host-defense peptides are natural antibiotics produced by multicellular organisms to ward off bacterial infection. Since the discovery of these molecules in the 1980s, a great deal of effort has been devoted to elucidating their mechanisms of action and to developing analogues with improved properties for possible therapeutic use. The vast majority of this effort has focused on materials composed of a single type of molecule, most commonly a peptide with a specific sequence of Î±-amino acid residues. We have recently shown that sequence-random nylon-3 copolymers can mimic favorable properties of host-defense peptides, and here we document structureâactivity relationships in this polymer family. Although the polymers are heterogeneous in terms of subunit order and stereochemistry, these materials display structureâactivity relationships comparable to those that have been documented among host-defense peptides and analogous synthetic peptides. Previously such relationships have been interpreted in terms of a specific and regular folding pattern (usually an Î±-helix), but our findings show that these correlations between covalent structure and biological activity do not require the adoption of a specific or regular conformation. In some cases our observations suggest alternative interpretations of results obtained with discrete peptides.},

	abstract = {We introduce âlibrary-based Monte Carloâ {(LBMC)} simulation, which performs Boltzmann sampling of molecular systems based on precalculated statistical libraries of molecular-fragment configurations, energies, and interactions. The library for each fragment can be Boltzmann distributed and thus account for all correlations internal to the fragment. {LBMC} can be applied to both atomistic and coarse-grained models, as we demonstrate in this âproof-of-principleâ report. We first verify the approach in a toy model and in implicitly solvated all-atom polyalanine systems. We next study five proteins, up to 309 residues in size. On the basis of atomistic equilibrium libraries of peptide-plane configurations, the proteins are modeled with fully atomistic backbones and simplified GoÌ-like interactions among residues. We show that full equilibrium sampling can be obtained in days to weeks on a single processor, suggesting that more accurate models are well within reach. For the future, {LBMC} provides a convenient platform for constructing adjustable or mixed-resolution models: the configurations of all atoms can be stored at no run-time cost, while an arbitrary subset of interactions is âturned onâ.},

	doi = {10.1021/jp801688p},
	abstract = {We explored the possibility of improving the accuracy and precision of free-energy differences estimated via expanded ensembles by manipulation of the biasing weights. Three different weighing approaches were compared: the flat histogram {(FH)} method, the optimized ensemble {(OE)} method, and a method introduced in this work, denoted {MinVar,} which aims to explicitly minimize the expected variance. The performance of these three methods was tested for the simulation of chemical potentials in systems of symmetric diblock copolymers with chain lengths of either 10 or 4 beads, and a system of one large hard sphere of diameter 10d immersed in a fluid of hard spheres of diameter d. In addition, the effect of the weighing method on the observed accuracy was investigated for different choices of macrostate staging and for both optimized and nonoptimized acceptance ratio methods for calculating free-energy differences. In the diblock copolymer systems, we found that the maximum attainable accuracy can be limited by correlations between the samples, causing the ârealâ observed variances to be much larger than the expected âidealâ ones. Hence, if the formal minimization of the variance, as aimed by the {MinVar} method, occurs at the expense of increasing the correlations in the data, the accuracy may actually decrease. Although maximizing the number of round trips between initial and final macrostates (as aimed by the {OE} method) was found to be directly related to data decorrelation, this only translates into increased accuracy if the correlations are the major source of errors in the free energy estimates. Finally, for the hard sphere system, we found that the {MinVar} method performs better than both the {OE} and {FH} methods even though the {MinVar} method in this case never completes a round trip, illustrating that maximizing the number of round trips for fixed computational cost does not necessarily lead to increased precision.},

Thus, the flow line will typically contain work in process {(WIP),} that is, jobs that have been previously released to the system. Our goal is to develop a job release schedule that not only minimizes tardiness but also maximizes flexibility. The philosophy can be characterized as one that seeks to "release as late as possible, but no later!" Our methodology is based on Monte Carlo simulation and consequent optimization by a method that became known as "stochastic counterpart" or "sample path" simulation-based optimization techniques. We use this method to minimize an expected value objective function that contains terms for tardiness and flow time "costs." We include a discussion of how the cost parameters of this objective function can be obtained by considering a "characteristic curve" for the system. We also discuss means for obtaining sensitivity analysis with respect to due dates and service times distributions parameters. We conclude with a numerical example.},

Accordingly, new antivirals directed at the M2 and neuraminidase proteins, and against the hemagglutinin protein, are being developed. In addition, elucidation of the structural basis for several crucial functions of other viral proteins (specifically the non-structural {NS1A} protein, the nucleoprotein and the viral polymerase) has identified novel targets for the development of new antivirals.

	abstract = {Influenza A viruses cause a highly contagious respiratory disease in humans and are responsible for periodic widespread epidemics with high mortality rates. The influenza A virus {NS1} protein {(NS1A)} plays a key role in countering host antiviral defense and in virulence. The 73-residue N-terminal domain of {NS1A} {(NS1A-(1-73))} forms a symmetric homodimer with a unique six-helical chain fold. It binds canonical A-form double-stranded {RNA} {(dsRNA).} Mutational inactivation of this {dsRNA} binding activity of {NS1A} highly attenuates virus replication. Here, we have characterized the unique structural features of the {dsRNA} binding surface of {NS1A-(1-73)} using {NMR} methods and describe the {2.1-A} x-ray crystal structure of the corresponding {dsRNA} binding domain from human influenza B virus {NS1B-(15-93).} These results identify conserved {dsRNA} binding surfaces on both {NS1A-(1-73)} and {NS1B-(15-93)} that are very different from those indicated in earlier "working models" of the complex between {dsRNA} and {NS1A-(1-73).} The combined {NMR} and crystallographic data reveal highly conserved surface tracks of basic and hydrophilic residues that interact with {dsRNA.} These tracks are structurally complementary to the polyphosphate backbone conformation of A-form {dsRNA} and run at an [{\textasciitilde}]45{degrees} angle relative to the axes of helices {alpha}2/{alpha}2'. At the center of this {dsRNA} binding epitope, and common to {NS1} proteins from influenza A and B viruses, is a deep pocket that includes both hydrophilic and hydrophobic amino acids. This pocket provides a target on the surface of the {NS1} protein that is potentially suitable for the development of antiviral drugs targeting both influenza A and B viruses.},

Its N-terminal {RNA-binding} domain binds {dsRNA.} The only amino acid absolutely required for {dsRNA} binding is the R at position 38. To identify the role of this {dsRNA-binding} activity during influenza A virus infection, we generated a recombinant influenza {A/Udorn/72} virus expressing an {NS1A} protein containing an {RNA-binding} domain in which R38 is mutated to A. This {R38A} mutant virus is highly attenuated, and the mutant {NS1A} protein, like the {WT} protein, is localized in the nucleus. Using the {R38A} mutant virus, we establish that {dsRNA} binding by the {NS1A} protein does not inhibit production of {IFN-Î²} {mRNA.} Rather, we demonstrate that the primary role of this {dsRNA-binding} activity is to protect the virus against the antiviral state induced by {IFN-Î².} Pretreatment of A549 cells with {IFN-Î²} for 6 h did not inhibit replication of {WT} Udorn virus, whereas replication of {R38A} mutant virus was inhibited 1,000-fold. Using both {RNA} interference in A549 cells and mouse knockout cells, we show that this enhanced sensitivity to {IFN-Î²-induced} antiviral activity is due predominantly to the activation of {RNase} L. Because activation of {RNase} L is totally dependent on {dsRNA} activation of 2â²-5â² oligo {(A)} synthetase {(OAS),} it is likely that the primary role of {dsRNA} binding by the {NS1A} protein in virus-infected cells is to sequester {dsRNA} away from 2â²-5â² {OAS.}},

	doi = {10.1016/j.virol.2007.01.038},
	abstract = {It is not known how influenza A viruses, important human pathogens, counter {PKR} activation, a crucial host antiviral response. Here we elucidate this mechanism. We show that the direct binding of {PKR} to the {NS1} protein in vitro that results in inhibition of {PKR} activation requires the {NS1} 123-127 amino acid sequence. To establish whether such direct binding of {PKR} to the {NS1} protein is responsible for inhibiting {PKR} activation in infected cells, we generated recombinant influenza {A/Udorn/72} viruses expressing {NS1} proteins in which amino acids 123/124 or 126/127 are changed to alanines. In cells infected with these mutant viruses, {PKR} is activated, {eIF-2[alpha]} is phosphorylated and viral protein synthesis is inhibited, indicating that direct binding of {PKR} to the 123-127 sequence of the {NS1} protein is necessary and sufficient to block {PKR} activation in influenza A virus-infected cells. Unexpectedly, the 123/124 mutant virus is not attenuated because reduced viral protein synthesis is offset by enhanced viral {RNA} synthesis at very early times of infection. These early viral {RNAs} include those synthesized predominantly at later times during wild-type virus infection, demonstrating that wild-type temporal regulation of viral {RNA} synthesis is absent in 123/124 virus-infected cells. Enhanced early viral {RNA} synthesis after 123/124 virus infection also occurs in mouse {PKR-/-} cells, demonstrating that {PKR} activation and deregulation of the time course of viral {RNA} synthesis are not coupled. These results indicate that the 123/124 site of the {NS1A} protein most likely functionally interacts with the viral polymerase to mediate temporal regulation of viral {RNA} synthesis. This interaction would occur in the nucleus, whereas {PKR} would bind to {NS1A} proteins in the cytoplasm prior to their import into the nucleus.},

	abstract = {{HIV-1} reverse transcriptase {(RT)} is an important target for drugs used in the treatment of {AIDS.} Drugs known as non-nucleoside {RT} inhibitors {(NNRTI)} appear to alter the structural and dynamical properties of {RT} which in turn inhibit {RT's} ability to transcribe. Molecular dynamics {(MD),} principal component analysis {(PCA),} and binding free energy simulations are employed to explore the dynamics of {RT} and its interaction with the bound {NNRTI} nevirapine, for both wild-type and mutant {(V106A,} {Y181C,} {Y188C)} {RT.} These three mutations commonly arise in the presence of nevirapine and result in resistance to the drug. We show that a bound {NNRTI} hinders the motion of almost all {RT} amino acids. The mutations, located in the non-nucleoside {RT} inhibitor binding pocket, partially restore {RT} flexibility. The binding affinities calculated by molecular {mechanics/PoissonBoltzmann} surface accessibility {(MM-PBSA)} show that nevirapine interacts stronger with wild-type {RT} than with mutant {RT.} The mutations cause a loss of van der Waals interactions between the drug and the binding pocket. The results from this study suggest that a good inhibitor should efficiently enter and maximally occupy the binding pocket, thereby interacting effectively with the amino acids around the binding pocket.},

	abstract = {Human immunodeficiency virus-1 reverse transcriptase {(RT)} inhibition is a major focus of current {anti-AIDS} drug discovery and development programs, comprising 17 of the 31 Food and Drug Administration-approved compounds. The emergence of the non-nucleoside {RT} inhibitor {(NNRTI)} class of compounds provides a highly specific and structurally diverse set of drugs, which act noncompetitively to perturb normal {RT} function. Despite a relatively rich set of crystallographic data of {RT} in various states, details of the allosteric modulation of {RT} dynamics by {NNRTIs} are lacking. Capturing this inhibitory mechanism could fuel the design of more effective inhibitors at the {NNRTI} site and also drive the identification of novel allosteric sites. To address this, we have performed multicopy molecular dynamics {(MD)} simulations of {RT} in the presence and absence of the {NNRTI} nevirapine (cumulative total simulation time, 360 ns). By comparing the collective motions of the {MD} and crystallographic structures, we demonstrate that the chief effect of {NNRTIs} is to constrain a key rigid-body motion between the "fingers" and "thumb" subdomains of the p66 subunit. We show that the {NNRTI} binding pocket {(NNIBP)} is proximal to the hinge points for this essential motion, and {NNRTIs} therefore act as "molecular wedges," sterically blocking the full range of motion. To explain how this impaired movement might result in the experimentally observed loss of polymerase activity, we show that the motion influences the geometry of key catalytic residues on opposite faces of the {NNIBP.} From a methodological point of view, our results suggest that the multicopy {MD} simulation approach is very useful when studying proteins that perform such large conformational changes.},

Concurrently, computing grids and {CPU} clusters have facilitated the development of structure-based tools that are able to screen hundreds of thousands of molecules. Smaller, 'smarter' combinatorial and focused parallel libraries have replaced the unfocused large libraries in the drug design paradigm of the 21st century.

R-group searching would desirably consider {pIC50} contribution forecasts as well as ligand similarities or docking scores. However, R-group searching, with or without {pIC50} forecasts, is currently not practical. The most prevalent and reliable source of {pIC50} predictions, existing {3D-QSAR} approaches, is also difficult and somewhat subjective. Yet in 25 of 25 trials on data sets on which a field-based {3D-QSAR} treatment had already succeeded, substitution of objective (canonically generated) topomer poses for the original structure-guided manual alignments produced acceptable {3D-QSAR} models, on average having almost equivalent statistical quality to the published models, and with negligible effort. Their overall {pIC50} prediction error is 0.805, calculated as the average over these 25 topomer {CoMFA} models in the standard deviations of {pIC50} predictions, derived from the 1109 possible {âleave-out-one-R-groupâ} {(LOORG)} {pIC50} contributions. {(This} novel {LOORG} protocol provides a more realistic and stringent test of prediction accuracy than the customary âleave-out-one-compoundâ {LOO} approach.) The associated average predictive r2 of 0.495 indicates a {pIC50} prediction accuracy roughly halfway between perfect and useless. To assess the ability of {topomer-CoMFA} based virtual screening to identify âhighly activeâ R-groups, a Receiver Operating Curve {(ROC)} approach was adopted. Using, as the binary criterion for a âhighly activeâ R-group, a predicted {pIC50} greater than the top 25\% of the observed {pIC50} range, the {ROC} area averaged across the 25 topomer {CoMFA} models is 0.729. Conventionally interpreted, the odds that a âhighly activeâ R-group will indeed confer such a high {pIC50} are 0.729/(1â0.729) or almost 3 to 1. To confirm that virtual screening within large collections of realized structures would provide a useful quantity and variety of R-group suggestions, combining shape similarity with the âhighly activeâ {pIC50,} the 50 searches provided by these 25 models were applied to 2.2 million structurally distinct R-group candidates among 2.0 million structures within a {ZINC} database, identifying an average of 5705 R-groups per search, with the highest predicted {pIC50} combination averaging 1.6 log units greater than the highest reported {pIC50s.}},

finding novel lead compounds. Although these ârandomâ methods sample larger areas of chemical space than traditional synthetic
approaches, only a relatively small percentage of all possible compounds are practically accessible. It is therefore helpful
to select regions of chemical space that have greater likelihood of yielding useful leads. When three-dimensional structural
data are available for the target molecule this can be achieved by applying structure-based computational design methods to
focus the combinatorial library. This is advantageous over the standard usage of computational methods to design a small number
of specific novel ligands, because here computation is employed as part of the combinatorial design process and so is required
only to determine a propensity for binding of certain chemical moieties in regions of the target molecule. This paper describes
the application of the Multiple Copy Simultaneous Search {(MCSS)} method, an active site mapping and de novo structure-based
design tool, to design a focused combinatorial library for the class {II} {MHC} protein {HLA-DR4.} Methods for the synthesizing
and screening the computationally designed library are presented; evidence is provided to show that binding was achieved.
Although the structure of the protein-ligand complex could not be determined, experimental results including cross-exclusion
of a known {HLA-DR4} peptide ligand {(HA)} by a compound from the library. Computational model building suggest that at least
one of the ligands designed and identified by the methods described binds in a mode similar to that of native peptides.},

The program takes an initial set of compounds and iteratively builds new compounds based on the fitness scores of the previous set of compounds. We describe the particulars of the {ADAPT} algorithm and its application to three well-studied target systems.

Because traditional thermodynamic integration or perturbation approaches are hardly feasible for these numbers of compounds, the one-step perturbation approach is applied and is shown to yield accurate results based on only two 2-ns molecular dynamics simulations of an unphysical, judiciously chosen, reference state. The mean absolute difference between the calculated and experimental binding free energies for the 17 compounds is 3.4 {kJ/mol,} which illustrates the accuracy of the {GROMOS} biomolecular force field used. Excluding the three largest ligands from the comparison reduces the deviation to 2.0 {kJ/mol} (i.e., \&lt; {kBT).} Apart from the relative free energy, structural information about the binding mode and binding orientation for every compound can also be extracted from the simulation, showing that a ligand bound to its receptor cannot be represented by a single conformation, but it samples an ensemble of different orientations.

Depending on the choice of reference compound, relative free energies of binding rigid ligands to the ligand-binding domain of the estrogen receptor can be obtained that show good agreement with the experimental values. The approach presented here can easily be applied to many rigid ligands, and it should be relatively easy to extend the method to account for ligand flexibility.

	doi = {10.1021/ar800009n},
	abstract = {The functions performed by proteins and nucleic acids provide the foundation for life. Chemists have recently begun to ask whether it is possible to design synthetic oligomers that approach the structural and functional complexities of these biopolymers. The study of foldamers, non-natural oligomers displaying discrete folding propensities, has demonstrated that there are several synthetic backbones that exhibit biopolymer-like conformational behavior. Early work in this area focused on oligomers comprised of a single type of monomer subunit, but recent efforts have highlighted the potential of mixed or âheterogeneousâ backbones to expand the structural and functional repertoire of foldamers. In this Account, we illustrate the promise of heterogeneous backbone foldamers by focusing on examples containing both Î±- and Î²-amino acid residues. Some Î²-residues bear protein-like side chains, while others have cyclic structures that confer conformational rigidity. The study of heterogeneous backbone foldamers has several advantages over that of their homogeneous backbone counterparts, including access to many new molecular shapes based on variations in the stoichiometries and patterns of the subunit combinations and improved prospects for side chain diversification. Recent efforts to develop Î±/Î²-peptide foldamers can be divided into two conceptually distinct classes. The first includes entities prepared using a âblockâ strategy, in which Î±-peptide segments and Î²-peptide segments are combined to form a hybrid oligomer. The second class encompasses designs in which Î±- and Î²-amino acid monomers are interspersed in a regular pattern throughout an oligomer sequence. One Î±/Î²-peptide helical secondary structure, containing {Cî»O(i)Â·Â·Â·HâN(i+4)} H-bonds analogous to those in the Î±-helix, has been shown via crystallography to form helix bundle quaternary structures. Desirable biological functions have been elicited from Î±/Î²-peptide foldamers. Efforts to mimic naturally occurring host-defense Î±-peptides have yielded new antimicrobial agents and have led to a reexamination of the long-held views regarding structureâactivity relationships among these Î±-peptides and their analogues. Foldamers offer new platforms for mimicry of the molecular surfaces involved in specific proteinâprotein recognition events; recent achievements in the preparation of Î±/Î²-peptide inhibitors of the proteinâprotein interactions involved in apoptotic signaling (e.g., between {Bcl-xL} and pro-apoptotic partners) have revealed the benefits of employing heterogeneous backbones relative to homogeneous backbones for foldamer-based designs. These initial successes in the development of Î±/Î²-peptides exhibiting specific biological activities highlight the potential of heterogeneous backbone foldamers for use in biomedical applications and provide guidelines for future studies into new target functions.},

Our findings suggest that for runs of or around ten generations' duration--as is typical in {DE--there} is little difference between the way in which {DE} needs to be configured in the high- and low-throughput regimes, nor across different degrees of landscape epistasis. In all cases, a high selection pressure (but not an extreme one) combined with a moderately high mutation rate works best, while crossover provides some benefit but only on the less rugged landscapes. These genetic algorithms were also compared with a "model-based approach" from the literature, which uses sequential fixing of the problem parameters based on fitting a linear model. Overall, we find that purely evolutionary techniques fare better than do model-based approaches across all but the smoothest landscapes.},

It was found that the leucine residues at positions 148 and 151 were essential for reaction with antisera raised against intact virus. A lesser contribution was derived from the glutamine and alanine residues at positions 149 and 152, respectively. Aside from the practical significance for locating and examining epitopes at high resolution, these findings may lead to better understanding of the basis of antigen-antibody interaction and antibody specificity.},

	abstract = {The backbone internal dynamics of the wild-type 129 amino acid [alpha]/[beta] parallel protein {CheY} and its double mutant {F14N/P110G} are analysed here by the hydrogen-exchange method. The {F14N} mutation is known to stabilise the protein and to accelerate refolding while {P110G} is destabilising and accelerates unfolding. We first assigned and characterised the double mutant by nuclear magnetic resonance {(NMR),} to try and discover any possible conformational change induced by the two mutations. The main difference between the two proteins is a favourable N-capping interaction of the newly introduced Asn14 side-chain at the beginning of the first [alpha]-helix ([alpha]-helix A). Second, we have measured the exchange rates in the wild-type and mutant {CheY.} In the first case the observed protection factors are slightly dispersed around an average value. According to their distribution in the structure, protein stability is highest on one face of the central [beta]-sheet, in the surroundings of the main hydrophobic core formed by side-chains of residues in [beta]-strands I, {II} and {III} and helices A and E. The mutations in the double mutant protein affect two distinct subdomains differently (from [beta]-strand I to {III} and from [alpha]-helix C to the end). In the second subdomain the number of protected protons is reduced with respect to those in the wild-type. This differential behaviour can be explained by a selective decrease in stability of the second folding subdomain produced by the {P110G} mutation and the opposite effect in the first subdomain, produced by the {F14N} mutation. {[alpha]-Helix} A, which is involved together with [beta]-strands I and {III} in the folding nucleus of {CheY,} shows the largest protection factors in both proteins.},

It has been shown that the variable domains of these heavy chain antibodies (the {VHH} fragments) are functional at or after exposure to high temperatures, in contrast to conventional antibodies {[Linden} van der, R. H. J., et al. (1999) Biochim. Biophys. Acta 1431, 3744]. For a detailed understanding of the higher thermostability of these {VHH} fragments, knowledge of their structure and conformational dynamics is required. As a first step toward this goal, we report here the essentially complete {1H} and {15N} {NMR} backbone resonance assignments of a llama {VHH} antibody fragment, and an extensive analysis of the structure at higher temperatures. The {HD} exchange {NMR} data at 300 K indicate that the framework of the llama {VHH} fragment is highly protected with a {DeltaGex} of {\textgreater}5.4 kcal/mol, while more flexibility is observed for surface residues, particularly in the loops and the two outer strands (residues 47, 1013, and 5860) of the beta-sheet. The {CD} data indicate a reversible, two-state unfolding mechanism with a melting transition at 333 K and a {DeltaHm} of 56 kcal/mol. {HD} exchange studies using {NMR} and {ESI-MS} show that below 313 K exchange occurs through local unfolding events whereas above 333 K exchange mainly occurs through global unfolding. The lack of a stable core at high temperatures, observed for {VHH} fragments, has also been observed for conventional antibody fragments. The main distinction between the llama {VHH} fragment and conventional antibody fragments is the reversibility of the thermal unfolding process, explaining its retained functionality after exposure to high temperatures.},

The protein backbone is highly rigid {({\textless}S2{\textgreater}=0.924Ç.005)} and displays little variation in picosecond-nanosecond time scale dynamics over the structure. The loop structure containing the axial methionine ligand (loop 3) displays anomalous rigidity, which is attributed to its high proline content. Also reported are protection factors calculated from hydrogen-exchange rates. These data reveal that loop 3 residues, including the axial methionine, are protected from exchange as a result of long-range hydrogen-bonding interactions. These results are contrasted with data reported for Saccharomyces cerevisiae iso-1-ferricytochrome c, which displays higher overall flexibility {({\textless}S2{\textgreater}=0.80Ç.07),} greater variation of dynamics as a function of structure, and low protection factors for loop 3.

	abstract = {The folding/unfolding equilibrium of the alpha-spectrin {SH3} domain has been measured by {NMR-detected} hydrogen/deuterium exchange and by differential scanning calorimetry. Protection factors against exchange have been obtained under native conditions for more than half of the residues in the domain. Most protected residues are located at the beta-strands, the short 310 helix, and part of the long {RT} loop, whereas the loops connecting secondary structure elements show no measurable protection. Apparent stability constants per residue and their corresponding Gibbs energies have been calculated from the exchange experiments. The most stable region of the {SH3} domain is defined by the central portions of the beta-strands. The peptide binding region, on the other hand, is composed of a highly stable region (residues 5357) and a highly unstable region, the loop between residues 3441 {(n-Src} loop). All residues in the domain have apparent Gibbs energies lower than the global unfolding Gibbs energy measured by differential scanning calorimetry, indicating that under our experimental conditions the amide exchange of all residues in the {SH3} domain occurs primarily via local unfolding reactions. A structure-based thermodynamic analysis has allowed us to predict correctly the thermodynamics of the global unfolding of the domain and to define the ensemble of conformational states that quantitatively accounts for the observed pattern of hydrogen exchange protection. These results demonstrate that under native conditions the {SH3} domain needs to be considered as an ensemble of conformations and that the hydrogen exchange data obtained under those conditions cannot be interpreted by a two-state equilibrium. The observation that specific regions of a protein are able to undergo independent local folding/unfolding reactions indicates that under native conditions the scale of cooperative interactions is regional rather than global.},

The conformational stabilities of these toxins are compared based on temperature-dependent chemical shifts and amide proton exchange kinetics using two-dimensional {NMR} spectroscopy. The structure of {CTX} {III} is found to be significantly more stable than that of {CBTX.} In both the toxins, beta-strand {III} appears to constitute the stability core. In {CTX} {III,} the stability of the triple-stranded beta-sheet domain is observed to be markedly higher than the double-stranded beta-sheet segment. In contrast, in {CBTX,} both structural domains (double- and triple-stranded beta-sheet domains) appear to contribute equally to the stability of the protein. Estimation of the free energy of exchange {(DeltaGex)} of residues in {CBTX} and {CTX} {III} reveals that the enhanced stability of the structure of {CTX} {III} stems from the strong interactions among the beta-strands constituting the triple-stranded beta-sheet domain and also the molecular forces bridging the residues at the N- and C-terminal ends of the molecule.},

Large changes observed between the two forms of {BLA} are mainly limited to the Ca2+-binding region of the protein. These data suggest that Na+ stabilises the native apo state through the screening of repulsive negative charges, at the Ca2+-binding site or elsewhere, rather than by a specific interaction at the vacant Ca2+-binding site. The hydrogen exchange protection of residues in the Ca2+-binding loop and the C-helix is reduced in the apo form compared to that in the holo form. This indicates that the dynamic behaviour of this region of the protein is substantially increased in the absence of the bound Ca2+. Real-time {NMR} experiments show that the rearrangements of the structure associated with the conversion of the holo to apo form of the protein do not involve the detectable population of partially unfolded intermediates. Rather, the conversion appears to involve local reorganisations of the structure in the vicinity of the Ca2+-binding site that are coupled to the intrinsic fluctuations in the protein structure.},

These results highlight the importance of accounting for native-state protein dynamics in making comparisons with ensemble-averaged experimental data and suggest that even a modest number of structures of a protein determined under different conditions, or with small variations in sequence, capture a representative subset of the true native-state ensemble.},

Hydrogen exchange experiments provide detailed information about the local stability and the solvent accessibility of different regions of the structures of folded proteins, protein complexes, and amyloid fibrils. We introduce an approach to predict protection factors from hydrogen exchange in proteins based on the knowledge of their amino acid sequences without the inclusion of any additional structural information. These results suggest that the propensity of different regions of the structures of globular proteins to undergo local unfolding events can be predicted from their amino acid sequences with an accuracy of 80\% or better.},

However, recent studies have suggested that {ff99SB} demonstrates poor agreement with J-coupling constants for short polyalanines. We performed extensive replica-exchange molecular-dynamics simulations on Ala3 and Ala5 in {TIP3P} and {TIP4P-Ew} solvent models. Our results suggest that the performance of {ff99SB} is among the best of currently available models. In addition, scalar coupling constants derived from simulations in the {TIP4P-Ew} model show a slight improvement over those obtained using the {TIP3P} model.

	abstract = {Protein function is dictated by protein conformation. For the protein biopharmaceutical industry, therefore, it is important to have analytical tools that can detect changes in protein conformation rapidly, accurately, and with high sensitivity. In this paper we show that hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry {(H/DX-MS)} can play an important role in fulfilling this need within the industry. {H/DX-MS} was used to assess both global and local conformational behavior of a recombinant monoclonal {IgG1} antibody, a major class of biopharmaceuticals. Analysis of exchange into the intact, glycosylated {IgG1} (and the Fab and Fc regions thereof) showed that the molecule was folded, highly stable, and highly amenable to analysis by this method using less than a nanomole of material. With improved chromatographic methods, peptide identification algorithms and data-processing steps, the analysis of deuterium levels in peptic peptides produced after labeling was accomplished in 1-2 days. On the basis of peptic peptide data, exchange was localized to specific regions of the antibody. Changes to {IgG1} conformation as a result of deglycosylation were determined by comparing exchange into the glycosylated and deglycosylated forms of the antibody. Two regions of the {IgG1} (residues 236-253 and 292-308) were found to have altered exchange properties upon deglycosylation. These results are consistent with previous findings concerning the role of glycosylation in the interaction of {IgG1} with Fc receptors. Moreover, the data clearly illustrate how {H/DX-MS} can provide important characterization information on the higher order structure of antibodies and conformational changes that these molecules may experience upon modification.},

The performance of the system, in terms of the repeatability and reproducibility of the measurement of protein hydrogen/deuterium exchange, was assessed over a 2-month period. The sensitivity of the measurement of hydrogen exchange towards several parameters was assessed, which allowed their impact on the reproducibility to be discussed. The parameters assessed were the temperature of the {HPLC} columns and switching valves, the temperature of the quench solutions, the {pH} of the mobile phase, the {pH} of the quenched solution, the acid used in the mobile phase and the analytical column used.},

	abstract = {Allostery describes altered protein function at one site due to a perturbation at another site. One mechanism of allostery involves correlated motions, which can occur even in the absence of substantial conformational change. We present a novel method, {âMutInfâ,} to identify statistically significant correlated motions from equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach analyzes both backbone and side chain motions using internal coordinates to account for the gear-like twists that can take place even in the absence of the large conformational changes typical of traditional allosteric proteins. We quantify correlated motions using a mutual information metric, which we extend to incorporate data from multiple short simulations and to filter out correlations that are not statistically significant. Applying our approach to uncover mechanisms of cooperative small molecule binding in human interleukin-2, we identify clusters of correlated residues from 50 ns of molecular dynamics simulations. Interestingly, two of the clusters with the strongest correlations highlight known cooperative small-molecule binding sites and show substantial correlations between these sites. These cooperative binding sites on interleukin-2 are correlated not only through the hydrophobic core of the protein but also through a dynamic polar network of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions. Since this approach identifies correlated conformations in an unbiased, statistically robust manner, it should be a useful tool for finding novel or âorphanâ allosteric sites in proteins of biological and therapeutic importance.},

	doi = {10.1128/JVI.01805-08},
	abstract = {The innate immune system guards against virus infection through a variety of mechanisms including mobilization of the host interferon system, which attacks viral products mainly at a posttranscriptional level. The influenza virus {NS1} protein is a multifunctional facilitator of virus replication, one of whose actions is to antagonize the interferon response. Since {NS1} is required for efficient virus replication, it was reasoned that chemical inhibitors of this protein could be used to further understand virus-host interactions and also serve as potential new antiviral agents. A yeast-based assay was developed to identify compounds that phenotypically suppress {NS1} function. Several such compounds exhibited significant activity specifically against influenza A virus in cell culture but had no effect on the replication of another {RNA} virus, respiratory syncytial virus. Interestingly, cells lacking an interferon response were drug resistant, suggesting that the compounds block interactions between {NS1} and the interferon system. Accordingly, the compounds reversed the inhibition of beta interferon {mRNA} induction during infection, which is known to be caused by {NS1.} In addition, the compounds blocked the ability of {NS1} protein to inhibit double-stranded {RNA-dependent} activation of a transfected beta interferon promoter construct. The effects of the compounds were specific to {NS1,} because they had no effect on the ability of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus papainlike protease protein to block beta interferon promoter activation. These data demonstrate that the function of {NS1} can be modulated by chemical inhibitors and that such inhibitors will be useful as probes of biological function and as starting points for clinical drug development.},
