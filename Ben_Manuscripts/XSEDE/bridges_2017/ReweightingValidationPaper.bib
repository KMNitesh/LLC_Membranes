abstract = {Controlling the crystal structure of transparent metal oxides is essential for tailoring the properties of these polymorphic materials to specific applications. The structural control is usually done via solid state phase transformation at high temperature or pressure. Here, we report the kinetic study of in situ phase transformation of In2O3 nanocrystals from metastable rhombohedral phase to stable cubic phase during their colloidal synthesis. By examining the phase content as a function of time using the model fitting approach, we identified two distinct coexisting mechanisms, surface and interface nucleation. It is shown that the mechanism of phase transformation can be controlled systematically through modulation of temperature and precursor to solvent ratio. The increase in both of these parameters leads to gradual change from surface to interface nucleation, which is associated with the increased probability of nanocrystal contact formation in the solution phase. The activation energy for surface nucleation is found to be 144 ± 30 kJ/mol, very similar to that for interface nucleation. Despite the comparable activation energy, interface nucleation dominates at higher temperatures due to increased nanocrystal interactions. The results of this work demonstrate enhanced control over polymorphic nanocrystal systems and contribute to further understanding of the kinetic processes at the nanoscale, including nucleation, crystallization, and biomineralization.},

abstract = {The phenomenon of polymorphism, the ability of a molecule to adopt more than one crystal structure, is a well-established property of crystalline solids. The possible variations in physical properties between polymorphs make the reliable reproduction of a crystalline form essential for all research using organic materials, as well as quality control in manufacture. Thus, the last two decades have seen both an increase in interest in polymorphism and the availability of the computer power needed to make the computational prediction of organic crystal structures a practical possibility. In the past decade, researchers have made considerable improvements in the theoretical basis for calculating the sets of structures that are within the energy range of possible polymorphism, called crystal energy landscapes. It is common to find that a molecule has a wide variety of ways of packing with lattice energy within a few kilojoules per mole of the most stable structure. However, as we develop methods to search for and characterize "all" solid forms, it is also now usual for polymorphs and solvates to be found. Thus, the computed crystal energy landscape reflects and to an increasing extent "predicts" the emerging complexity of the solid state observed for many organic molecules. This Account will discuss the ways in which the calculation of the crystal energy landscape of a molecule can be used as a complementary technique to solid form screening for polymorphs. Current methods can predict the known crystal structure, even under "blind test" conditions, but such successes are generally restricted to those structures that are the most stable over a wide range of thermodynamic conditions. The other low-energy structures can be alternative polymorphs, which have sometimes been found in later experimental studies. Examining the computed structures reveals the various compromises between close packing, hydrogen bonding, and pi-pi stacking that can result in energetically feasible structures. Indeed, we have observed that systems with many almost equi-energetic structures that contain a common interchangeable motif correlate with a tendency to disorder and problems with control of the crystallization product. Thus, contrasting the computed crystal energy landscape with the known crystal structures of a given molecule provides a valuable complement to solid form screening, and the examination of the low-energy structures often leads to a rationalization of the forms found.},

MC methods cannot directly determine free energy or entropy because they are not ensemble averages. To get the free energy, one can do 'computer calorimetry' where the intermediate states can be nonphysical.

Given some set of data, what is the most statistically optimal way to determine the free enegy difference?

The process of calculating free energy differences is similar to the process of reactions coming to steady state, with rate constants as transition probabilities and concentrations as partition functions.

This can also be viewed as walking along two mountain ridges and trying to look to determine which is (on average?) higher.

This shift constant simply 'lowers the adjacent montain range' and then adds that effect back in at the end.

An equation for the phase space overlap is given as an integral over the multiple of the density over the average of the densities.},

abstract = {The effect of using a realistic model for the electrostatic forces on the calculated structures of molecular crystals is explored by using atomic multipoles derived from an SCF 6-31G** wave function. This was tested on a wide ranging database of 40 rigid organic molecules containing C, H, N, and O atoms, including nucleic acid bases, nonlinear optic materials, azabenzenes, nitrobenzenes, and simpler molecules. The distributed multipole electrostatic model, plus an empirical repulsion-dispersion potential, was able to successfully reproduce the lattice vectors and available heats of sublimation of the experimental room temperature structure in almost all cases. Scaling the electrostatic energy to allow for the effect of electron correlation on the molecular charge density generally improved the lattice energies and the calculated structures to a lesser extent. However, omitting the anisotropic multipole moments usually gave very poor, sometimes qualitatively wrong structures, emphasizing the sensitivity of these crystal structures to the electrostatic forces. We also investigated the sensitivity of the structures to the empirical repulsion-dispersion potential parameters by attempting to optimize these. Since the experimental structures are mainly reproduced to within the errors that could be attributed to the use of static minimization and rigid molecules, it appears that going beyond the atomic charge model to a realistic electrostatic model is a key development in the modeling of the crystal structures of polar and hydrogen-bonded molecules.},

abstract = {An extension of a recently reported algorithm (J. Comput. Chem., 26, 304 (2005)) for the prediction of the crystal structure of organic materials to molecules whose conformation is likely to be significantly affected by the packing forces is presented. The molecule is modelled as a set of rigid fragments connected by flexible torsion angles whose values in the crystalline environment are determined by the balance of intra- and inter-molecular forces. The intramolecular energy is initially computed using quantum mechanics over a grid in the space of flexible torsion angles. This allows the intramolecular energy to be expressed as a continuous and differentiable function of the torsion angles using multidimensional interpolants based on restricted cubic Hermite polynomials. The intermolecular electrostatic interactions are treated with a conformation-dependent atomic charge model, with the charges also being expressed as functions of the flexible torsion angles using restricted Hermite interpolants. Overall, this approach allows the computationally efficient, yet accurate, evaluation of the parts of the lattice enthalpy that depend on the molecular conformation. The proposed algorithm requires only the atomic connectivity of the molecule under consideration and performs an extensive search for local minima of the lattice enthalpy surface by using deterministic low-discrepancy sequences to ensure an optimal coverage of the search space. Candidate structures can be generated in the 59 most common space groups with one or more crystallographically independent entities. These are then used as starting points of local optimization calculations performed with a sequential quadratic programming algorithm, which makes use of analytical partial derivatives with respect to all inter and intra-molecular degrees of freedom. A parallelized implementation of the algorithm allows minimizations from several hundreds of thousands of initial guesses to be carried out in reasonable time. The algorithm is used to predict the crystal structures of the polymorphic system p-chlorobenzamide and to study the relative stability of the crystal structures of the diastereomeric salt pair (R)-1-phenylethylammonium, (R{\&}S)-2-phenylbutyrate.},

Multipoles through the quadrupole are assigned to each atomic center based on a distributed multipole analysis (DMA) derived from large basis set molecular orbital calculations on the water monomer. Polarization is treated via self-consistent induced atomic dipoles. A modified version of Thole's interaction model is used to damp induction at short range. Repulsion-dispersion (vdW) effects are computed from a buffered 14-7 potential. In a departure from most current water potentials, we find that significant vdW parameters are necessary on hydrogen as well as oxygen. The new potential is fully flexible and has been tested versus a variety of experimental data and quantum calculations for small clusters, liquid water, and ice. Overall, excellent agreement with experimental and high level ab initio results is obtained for numerous properties, including cluster structures and energetics and bulk thermodynamic and structural measures. The parametrization scheme described here is easily extended to other molecular systems, and the resulting water potential should provide a useful explicit solvent model for organic solutes and biopolymer modeling.},

Multipole moments are added to each atom up through quadropoles. 

A local coordinate is created at each atomic center, and di-pole and quadrupole moments are added. Both force and torque are generated at each site and the force is converted into forces between the multipole sites.

The polarization can either be additive (in which atoms in the same molecule do not polarize each other), or non-additive. In the nonadditive case, you must take care to avoid the 'polarization catastrophe' at very short range.},

abstract = {Circuits based on organic semiconductors are being actively explored for flexible, transparent and low-cost electronic applications. But to realize such applications, the charge carrier mobilities of solution-processed organic semiconductors must be improved. For inorganic semiconductors, a general method of increasing charge carrier mobility is to introduce strain within the crystal lattice. Here we describe a solution-processing technique for organic semiconductors in which lattice strain is used to increase charge carrier mobilities by introducing greater electron orbital overlap between the component molecules. For organic semiconductors, the spacing between cofacially stacked, conjugated backbones (the $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking distance) greatly influences electron orbital overlap and therefore mobility. Using our method to incrementally introduce lattice strain, we alter the $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking distance of 6,13-bis(triisopropylsilylethynyl) pentacene (TIPS-pentacene) from 3.33 {\AA} to 3.08 {\AA}. We believe that 3.08 {\AA} is the shortest $\pi$-$\pi$ stacking distance that has been achieved in an organic semiconductor crystal lattice (although a $\pi$-$\pi$ distance of 3.04 {\AA} has been achieved through intramolecular bonding). The positive charge carrier (hole) mobility in TIPS-pentacene transistors increased from 0.8 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) for unstrained films to a high mobility of 4.6 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) for a strained film. Using solution processing to modify molecular packing through lattice strain should aid the development of high-performance, low-cost organic semiconducting devices.},

abstract = {Fourteen experimental crystal structure determinations of paracetamol, covering two polymorphic forms and a range of temperatures, show the usual minor variations in the molecular structure, which reflect the limitations of X-ray crystallography and dynamical motion of the methyl group. Minima in the intermolecular lattice energy have been found starting from these experimental structures, keeping the molecular structure rigid and using the same distributed multipole-based model intermolecular potential in all calculations. These have been compared and contrasted with the lattice energy minima obtained using an optimised molecular model. Genuine crystal structure prediction requires the use of non-crystallographic molecular models, and so in this study we illustrate the accuracy that could be achieved in such a prediction study. The small variations in the experimental molecular structure produce variations of a few percent in the cell lengths and a few kJ mol of the lattice energy in the rigid molecule crystal structure minima. This produces considerable uncertainty in the calculated energy difference between the polymorphs. The structural and lattice energy differences between the experimental crystal structures and the corresponding lattice energy minima vary sufficiently with temperature and determination to show that the uncertainties in the molecular structure and neglect of temperature dominate this difference (of around 3{\%} in the cell lengths). Thus, this study suggests that the level of significance for refining model potentials by comparing lattice energy minima and experimental crystal structures is a few {\%} in the cell lengths. This is comparable with previous estimates based on the thermal expansion of this type of organic crystal structure between 0 K and room temperature},

abstract = {A collaborative workshop was held in May 1999 at the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre to test how well currently available methods of crystal structure prediction perform when given only the atomic connectivity for an organic compound. A blind test was conducted on a selection of four compounds and a wide range of methodologies representing the principal computer programs currently available were used. There were 11 participants who were allowed to propose at most three structures for each compound. No program gave consistently reliable results. However, seven proposed structures were close to an experimental one and were classified as `correct'. One compound occurred in two polymorphs, but only one form was predicted correctly among the calculated structures. The basic problem with lattice energy based methods of crystal structure prediction is that many structures are found within a few kJ mol-1 of the global minimum. The fine detail of the force-field methodology and parametrization influences the energy ranking within each method. Nevertheless, present methods may be useful in providing a set of structures as possible polymorphs for a given molecular structure.},

abstract = {Many organic molecules are emerging as having many crystalline forms, including polymorphs and solvates, as more techniques are being used to generate and characterise the organic solid state. The fundamental scientific and industrial interest in controlling crystallisation is inspiring the development of computational methods of predicting which crystal structures are thermodynamically feasible. Sometimes, computing this crystal energy landscape will reveal that a molecule has one way of packing with itself that is sufficiently more favourable than any other so only this crystal structure will be observed. More frequently, there will be many energy minima that are energetically feasible, showing approximately equi-energetic compromises between the various intermolecular interactions allowed by the conformational flexibility. Such cases generally lead to multiple solid forms. At the moment, we usually calculate the lattice energy landscape, an approximation to the real crystal energy landscape at 0 K. Despite its limitations, many studies show that this is a valuable complement to solid form screening, which helps in discovering new structures as well as rationalising the solid forms that are found in experimental searches. The range of factors that can determine which of the thermodynamically feasible crystal structures are observed polymorphs, shows the many further challenges in developing crystal energy landscapes as a tool for control of the organic solid state.},

Crystal energy studies often reveal that more than one energy minima exists for a given compound. This suggests that more than one structure can be experimentally observed. This information is only strictly true at 0K.

The idea of this field is to guide the design of new organic molecules where the physical property of interest was sensitive to crystal structure.


Crystal structure prediction techniques can be validated by blind crystal structure prediction tests.








About 50{\%} of drug molecules are polymorphic, and 80{\%} of pigments are polymorphic. By contrast, only 1{\%} of the crystals in the CSD have detailed charactrization of more than one polymorph.








Often, we find many energy minima within a few kJ/mol, casting doubt on crystal structure prediction, and on why we dont see more experimental structures.








benzene has many energy minima, but only a few free energy minima.








Polymorphic behavior can be practically ruled out by examining both the energy landscape and a limited crysallisation screen.








Close energy polymorphs are usually found by thermal analysis, slow crystallisation, or slurry experiments.








Success story of crystal structure prediction. A new motif of a anti-cancer drug was found to form in nitromethane. The previous form was always observed due to its crystallization in water, where the hydrogen binding forced form 1 to occur.








For carbamazepine, an extensive crystallisation screen found 3 new solvates.








Some drugs can have shear-induced polymorphs, such as asparin.








The accuracy of crystal energy landscapes depends on how well the intermolecular and intramolecular interactions can be estimated.








Switching from atomic point charge models to atomic multipole models (DMA) led to a significant improvement. 








Better solid state ab initio techniques as well as faster computers may be needed for increased accuracy.








An issue with QHT is that it cannot eliminate a lattice energy minima as not corresponding to a free energy minima.








Using MD and free energy methods allow one to track the effects of temperature as well as eliminate many lattice minima that go away at high temperatures.

abstract = {The melting point, enthalpy of fusion, and thermodynamic stability of two crystal polymorphs of the ionic liquid 1-n-butyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride are calculated using a thermodynamic integration-based atomistic simulation method. The computed melting point of the orthorhombic phase ranges from 365 to 369 K, depending on the classical force field used. This compares reasonably well with the experimental values, which range from 337 to 339 K. The computed enthalpy of fusion ranges from 19 to 29 kJ/mol, compared to the experimental values of 18.5-21.5 kJ/mol. Only one of the two force fields evaluated in this work yielded a stable monoclinic phase, despite the fact that both give accurate liquid state densities. The computed melting point of the monoclinic polymorph was found to be 373 K, which is somewhat higher than the experimental range of 318-340 K. The computed enthalpy of fusion was 23 kJ/mol, which is also higher than the experimental value of 9.3-14.5 kJ/mol. The simulations predict that the monoclinic form is more stable than the orthorhombic form at low temperature, in agreement with one set of experiments but in conflict with another. The difference in free energy between the two polymorphs is very small, due to the fact that a single trans-gauche conformational difference in an alkyl sidechain distinguishes the two structures. As a result, it is very difficult to construct simple classical force fields that are accurate enough to definitively predict which polymorph is most stable. A liquid phase analysis of the probability distribution of the dihedral angles in the alkyl chain indicates that less than half of the dihedral angles are in the gauche-trans configuration that is adopted in the orthorhombic crystal. The low melting point and glass forming tendency of this ionic liquid is likely due to the energy barrier for conversion of the remaining dihedral angles into the gauche-trans state. The simulation procedure used to perform the melting point calculations is an extension of the so-called pseudo-supercritical path sampling procedure. This study demonstrates that the method can be effectively applied to quite complex systems such as ionic liquids and that the appropriate choice of tethering potentials for a key step in the thermodynamic path can enable first order phase transitions to be avoided.},

Permanent atomic multipole moments through quadrupole moments have been derived from gas phase ab initio molecular orbital calculations. The van der Waals parameters are obtained by fitting to gas phase homodimer QM energies and structures, as well as experimental densities and heats of vaporization of neat liquids. As a validation, the hydrogen bonding energies and structures of gas phase heterodimers with water are evaluated using the resulting potential. For 32 homo- and heterodimers, the association energy agrees with ab initio results to within 0.4 kcal/mol. The RMS deviation of hydrogen bond distance from QM optimized geometry is less than 0.06 {\AA}. In addition, liquid self-diffusion and static dielectric constants computed from molecular dynamics simulation are consistent with experimental values. The force field is also used to compute the solvation free energy of 27 compounds not included in the parameterization process, with a RMS error of 0.69 kcal/mol. The results obtained in this study suggest the AMOEBA force field performs well across different environments and phases.

This is addressed in the present investigation by reporting detailed calculations of the reduction potentials of the blue copper proteins plastocyanin and rusticyanin using the QM/MM all-atom frozen density functional theory, FDFT, method. The relevant ab initio free energies are evaluated by using a classical reference potential. This approach appears to provide a general consistent and effective way for reproducing the configurational ensemble needed for consistent ab initio free energy calculations. The FDFT formulation allows us to treat a large part of the protein quantum mechanically by a consistently coupled QM/QM/MM embedding method while still retaining a proper configurational sampling. To establish the importance of proper configurational sampling and the need for a complete representation of the protein+solvent environment, we also consider several classical approaches. These include the semi-macroscopic PDLD/S-LRA method and classical all-atom simulations with and without a polarizable force field. The difference between the reduction potentials of the two blue copper proteins is reproduced in a reasonable way, and its origin is deduced from the different calculations. It is found that the protein permanent dipole tunes down the reduction potential for plastocyanin compared to the active site in regular water solvent, whereas in rusticyanin it is instead tuned up. This electrostatic environment, which is the major effect determining the reduction potential, is a property of the entire protein and solvent system and cannot be ascribed to any particular single interaction.},

A range of methodologies was used by the participating groups in order to evaluate the ability of the current computational methods to predict the crystal structures of the six organic molecules chosen as targets for this blind test. The first four targets, two rigid molecules, one semi-flexible molecule and a 1:1 salt, matched the criteria for the targets from CSP2007, while the last two targets belonged to two new challenging categories - a larger, much more flexible molecule and a hydrate with more than one polymorph. Each group submitted three predictions for each target it attempted. There was at least one successful prediction for each target, and two groups were able to successfully predict the structure of the large flexible molecule as their first place submission. The results show that while not as many groups successfully predicted the structures of the three smallest molecules as in CSP2007, there is now evidence that methodologies such as dispersion-corrected density functional theory (DFT-D) are able to reliably do so. The results also highlight the many challenges posed by more complex systems and show that there are still issues to be overcome.},

abstract = {Following the interest generated by two previous blind tests of crystal structure prediction (CSP1999 and CSP2001), a third such collaborative project (CSP2004) was hosted by the Cambridge Crystallographic Data Centre. A range of methodologies used in searching for and ranking the likelihood of predicted crystal structures is represented amongst the 18 participating research groups, although most are based on the global minimization of the lattice energy. Initially the participants were given molecular diagrams of three molecules and asked to submit three predictions for the most likely crystal structure of each. Unlike earlier blind tests, no restriction was placed on the possible space group of the target crystal structures. Furthermore, Z' = 2 structures were allowed. Part-way through the test, a partial structure report was discovered for one of the molecules, which could no longer be considered a blind test. Hence, a second molecule from the same category (small, rigid with common atom types) was offered to the participants as a replacement. Success rates within the three submitted predictions were lower than in the previous tests - there was only one successful prediction for any of the three ;blind' molecules. For the ;simplest' rigid molecule, this lack of success is partly due to the observed structure crystallizing with two molecules in the asymmetric unit. As in the 2001 blind test, there was no success in predicting the structure of the flexible molecule. The results highlight the necessity for better energy models, capable of simultaneously describing conformational and packing energies with high accuracy. There is also a need for improvements in search procedures for crystals with more than one independent molecule, as well as for molecules with conformational flexibility. These are necessary requirements for the prediction of possible thermodynamically favoured polymorphs. Which of these are actually realised is also influenced by as yet insufficiently understood processes of nucleation and crystal growth.},

These approaches consider the nonlinear solute-solvent$\backslash$ncoupling in a self-consistent way by incorporating the potential$\backslash$nfrom the solvent dipoles in the solute Hamiltonian, while considering$\backslash$nthe polarization of the solvent by the potential from the solute$\backslash$ncharges. The solvent models used include the simplified Langevin$\backslash$nDipoles (LD) model and the much more expensive surface constrained$\backslash$nAll Atom Solvent (SCAAS) model, which is combined with a free energy$\backslash$npertubation (FEP) approach. Both methods are effectively integrated$\backslash$nwith the quantum mechanical AMPAC package and can be easily combined$\backslash$nwith other quantum mechanical programs. The advantages of the present$\backslash$napproaches and their earlier versions over macroscopic reaction field$\backslash$nmodels and supermolecular approaches are considered.

The incorporation of a field-dependent hydrophobic term$\backslash$nin the LD free energy makes the present approach capable of evaluating$\backslash$nthe free energy of transfer of polar molecules from non polar solvents$\backslash$nto aqueous solutions.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurately modeling condensed phase processes is one of computation's most difficult challenges. Include the possibility that conformational dynamics may be coupled to chemical reactions, where multiscale (i.e., QM/MM) methods are needed, and this task becomes even more daunting.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Free energy simulations (i.e., molecular dynamics), multiscale modeling, and reweighting schemes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Herein, we present two new approaches for mitigating the aforementioned challenges. The first is a new chain-of-replica method (off-path simulations, OPS) for computing potentials of mean force (PMFs) along an easily defined reaction coordinate. This development is coupled with a new distributed, highly-parallel replica framework (REPDstr) within the CHARMM package. Validation of these new schemes is carried out on two processes that undergo conformational changes. First is the simple torsional rotation of butane, while a much more challenging glycosidic rotation (in vacuo and solvated) is the second. Additionally, a new approach that greatly improves (i.e., possibly an order of magnitude) the efficiency of computing QM/MM PMFs is introduced and compared to standard schemes. Our efforts are grounded in the recently developed method for efficiently computing QM-based free energies (i.e., QM-Non-Boltzmann Bennett, QM-NBB). Again, we validate this new technique by computing the QM/MM PMF of butane's torsional rotation.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The OPS-REPDstr method is a promising new approach that overcomes many limitations of standard pathway simulations in CHARMM. The combination of QM-NBB with pathway techniques is very promising as it offers significant advantages over current procedures.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nGENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: Efficiently computing potentials of mean force is a major, unresolved, area of interest.

Recently, Kong et al. proposed a formulation of Monte Carlo integration as a statistical model, making explicit what information is ignored and what is retained about the baseline measure. From simulated data, the baseline measure is estimated by maximum likelihood, and then integrals of interest are estimated by substituting the estimated measure. For two different situations in which independent observations are simulated from multiple distributions, we show that this likelihood approach achieves the lowest asymptotic variance possible by using estimating equations. In the first situation, the normalizing constants of the design distributions are estimated, and Meng andWong’s bridge sampling estimating equation is considered. In the second situation, the values of the normalizing constants are known, thereby imposing linear constraints on the baseline measure. Estimating equations including Hesterberg’s stratified importance sampling estimator, Veach and Guibas’s multiple importance sampling estimator, and Owen and Zhou’s method of control variates are considered.},

The average energy RMS deviation from the LMP2/cc-pVTZ(-f)//HF/6-31G** data is reduced by ca. 40{\%} from 0.81 to 0.47 kcal/mol as a result of the fitting for the electrostatically uncharged dipeptides. Transferability of the parameters is demonstrated by using the same alanine dipeptide-fitted backbone torsional parameters for all of the other dipeptides (with the appropriate side-chain refitting) and the alanine tetrapeptide. Parameters of nonbonded interactions have also been refitted for the sulfur-containing dipeptides (cysteine and methionine), and the validity of the new Coulombic charges and the van der Waals $\sigma$’s and ’s is proved through reproducing gas-phase energies of complex formation heats of vaporization and densities of pure model liquids. Moreover, a novel approach to fitting torsional parameters for electrostatically charged molecular systems has been presented and successfully tested on five dipeptides with charged side chains.},

In this work we present results of single crystal structure determinations as well as theoretical predictions for three 1 ratio 1 complexes between hydrophobic l- and d-amino acids (pseudoracemates), known from previous crystallographic work to form structures with one of two alternative hydrogen bonding arrangements. These are accurately reproduced in the theoretical predictions together with a series of patterns that have never been observed experimentally. In this bewildering forest of potential polymorphs, hydrogen bonding arrangements and molecular conformations, the theoretical predictions succeeded, for all three complexes, in finding the correct hydrogen bonding pattern. For two of the complexes, the calculations also reproduce the exact space group and side chain orientations in the best ranked predicted structure. This includes one complex for which the observed crystal packing clearly contradicted previous experience based on experimental data for a substantial number of related amino acid complexes. The results highlight the significant recent advances that have been made in computational methods for crystal structure prediction.},

Even though this leads to a reduction of dimensions, this can still be a high dimensional surface. Furthermore, it can be difficult to locate these minima and saddlepoints. This allows for efficient free energy difference estimates.

The SMART algorithm developed here can identify both saddlepoints and minima on the free energy landscape. The minima can then be used for free energy difference estimates, and the minima can be used as initial guesses of transitions to determine whether minima on the energy landscape interconvert.

The algorithm finds the minima and saddlepoints by alternating between minima search and saddlepoint search algorithms. This can be done with MC or MD, but MD is used here.

Traditional optimizations have decreasing timesteps, but here a fixed timestep with a normalized force is used.

Walking along in this trajectory leads to a cluster of configurations around minima and saddlepoints, which are called 'landmarks'.},

annote = {Polymorphism means that the materials has multiple observable crystal structures. Polymorphs can have different properties. Here the authors are looking at molybdenum oxide. In this case, the crystal structures have different electrical conductivity. The h-MoO3 phase has 550x higher conductivity than a-MoO3. 

The authors argue that the increased electrical conductivity is due to interstitial ammonia and water.

The interstitial ammonia and water causes a different charge transfer mechanism to be adopted in the h-MoO3 phase as opposed to the a-MoO3 phase. In h-MoO3 there is a bypass channel for charge transfer due to facile diffusion of ions through the matrix. In a-MoO3 only a polarization can occur. 

The authors also argue that the water and ammonium ions lead to a stabilization of the h-MoO3 phase. The evidence to support this is that heating the crystal leads to desorption of the interstitial H2O and NH4 which then leads to rapid depomposition to a-MoO3.

The remainder of the article discusses the synthesis procedure, where by the hydrothermal treatment preferentially leads to the synthesis of h-MoO3. The synthesized phase can be adjusted based on the amount of precipitant, the solvent medium, the reaction time and reaction temperature.

Pros: Lots of Colors and helpful figures

Cons: A' graphs are a bit confusing and lack detailed captions.

The presence of water and ammonium ions stabilizes the metastable phase h-MoO3. These also lead to increased electrical conductivity properties.

In the h-MoO3 phase, the water and NH4+ Ions allow electrical conduction through 'diffusion', while in the a-MoO3 phase the electrical conductino is purely through polarization which is much more resistive.},

abstract = {The combination of quantum mechanics (QM) with molecular mechanics (MM) offers a route to improved accuracy in the study of biological systems, and there is now significant research effort being spent to develop QM/MM methods that can be applied to the calculation of relative free energies. Currently, the computational expense of the QM part of the calculation means that there is no single method that achieves both efficiency and rigor; either the QM/MM free energy method is rigorous and computationally expensive, or the method introduces efficiency-led assumptions that can lead to errors in the result, or a lack of generality of application. In this paper we demonstrate a combined approach to form a single, efficient, and, in principle, exact QM/MM free energy method. We demonstrate the application of this method by using it to explore the difference in hydration of water and methane. We demonstrate that it is possible to calculate highly converged QM/MM relative free energies at the MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ/OPLS level within just two days of computation, using commodity processors, and show how the method allows consistent, high-quality sampling of complex solvent configurational change, both when perturbing hydrophilic water into hydrophobic methane, and also when moving from a MM Hamiltonian to a QM/MM Hamiltonian. The results demonstrate the validity and power of this methodology, and raise important questions regarding the compatibility of MM and QM/MM forcefields, and offer a potential route to improved compatibility.},

abstract = {The correct representation of solute-water interactions is essential for the accurate simulation of most biological phenomena. Several highly accurate quantum methods are available to deal with solvation by using both implicit and explicit solvents. So far, however, most evaluations of those methods were based on a single conformation, which neglects solute entropy. Here, we present the first test of a novel approach to determine hydration free energies that uses molecular mechanics (MM) to sample phase space and quantum mechanics (QM) to evaluate the potential energies. Free energies are determined by using re-weighting with the Non-Boltzmann Bennett (NBB) method. In this context, the method is referred to as QM-NBB. Based on snapshots from MM sampling and accounting for their correct Boltzmann weight, it is possible to obtain hydration free energies that incorporate the effect of solute entropy. We evaluate the performance of several QM implicit solvent models, as well as explicit solvent QM/MM for the blind subset of the SAMPL4 hydration free energy challenge. While classical free energy simulations with molecular dynamics give root mean square deviations (RMSD) of 2.8 and 2.3 kcal/mol, the hybrid approach yields an improved RMSD of 1.6 kcal/mol. By selecting an appropriate functional and basis set, the RMSD can be reduced to 1 kcal/mol for calculations based on a single conformation. Results for a selected set of challenging molecules imply that this RMSD can be further reduced by using NBB to reweight MM trajectories with the SMD implicit solvent model.},

The present work attempts to resolve this difficulty using molecular dynamics simulations with the AMOEBA polarizable force field and perturbation techniques to directly compute absolute solvation free energies for potassium, sodium, and chloride ions in liquid water and formamide. Corresponding calculations are also performed with two widely used nonpolarizable force fields. The simulations with the polarizable force field accurately reproduce in vacuo quantum mechanical results, experimental ion-cluster solvation enthalpies, and experimental solvation free energies for whole salts, while the other force fields do not. The results indicate that calculations with a polarizable force field can capture the thermodynamics of ion solvation and that the solvation free energies of the individual ions differ by several kilocalories from commonly cited values.},

abstract = {We present a Monte Carlo method for the direct evaluation of the difference between the free energies of two crystal structures. The method is built on a lattice-switch transformation that maps a configuration of one structure onto a candidate configuration of the other by "switching" one set of lattice vectors for the other, while keeping the displacements with respect to the lattice sites constant. The sampling of the displacement configurations is biased, multicanonically, to favor paths leading to gateway arrangements for which the Monte Carlo switch to the candidate configuration will be accepted. The configurations of both structures can then be efficiently sampled in a single process, and the difference between their free energies evaluated from their measured probabilities. We explore and exploit the method in the context of extensive studies of systems of hard spheres. We show that the efficiency of the method is controlled by the extent to which the switch conserves correlated microstructure. We also show how, microscopically, the procedure works: the system finds gateway arrangements which fulfill the sampling bias intelligently. We establish, with high precision, the differences between the free energies of the two close packed structures (fcc and hcp) in both the constant density and the constant pressure ensembles.},

@article{Plotnikov2011,
abstract = {Recent years have seen tremendous effort in the development of approaches with which to obtain quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) free energies for reactions in the condensed phase. Nevertheless, there remain significant challenges to address, particularly, the high computational cost involved in performing proper configurational sampling and, in particular, in obtaining ab initio QM/MM (QM(ai)/MM) free-energy surfaces. One increasingly popular approach that seems to offer an ideal way to progress in this direction is the elegant metadynamics (MTD) approach. However, in the current work, we point out the subtle efficiency problems associated with this approach and illustrate that we have at hand what is arguably a more powerful approach. More specifically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of an updated version of our original idea of using a classical reference potential for QM(ai)/MM calculations [J. Phys. Chem. 1995, 99, 17516)], which we refer to as paradynamics (PD). This approach is based on the use of an empirical valence bond (EVB) reference potential, which is already similar to the real ab initio potential. The reference potential is fitted to the ab initio potential by an iterative and, to a great degree, automated refinement procedure. The corresponding free-energy profile is then constructed using the refined EVB potential, and the linear response approximation (LRA) is used to evaluate the QM(ai)/MM activation free-energy barrier. The automated refinement of the EVB surface (and thus the reduction of the difference between the reference and ab initio potentials) is a key factor in accelerating the convergence of the LRA approach. We apply our PD approach to a test reaction, namely, the S(N)2 reaction between a chloride ion and methyl chloride, and demonstrate that, at present, this approach is far more powerful and cost-effective than the metadynamics approach (at least in its current implementation). We also discuss the general features of the PD approach in terms of its ability to explore complex systems and clarify that it is not a specialized approach limited to only accelerating QM(ai)/MM calculations with proper sampling, but rather can be used in a wide variety of applications. In fact, we point out that the use of a reference (CG) potential coupled with its PD refinement, as well as our renormalization approach, provides very general and powerful strategies that can be used very effectively to explore any property that has been studied by the MTD approach.},

abstract = {A new method called adaptive force matching (AFM) has been developed that is capable of producing high quality force fields for condensed phase simulations. This procedure involves the parametrization of force fields to reproduce ab initio forces obtained from condensed phase quantum-mechanics/molecular-mechanics (QM/MM) calculations. During the procedure, the MM part of the QM/MM is iteratively improved so as to approach ab initio quality. In this work, the AFM method has been tested to parametrize force fields for liquid water so that the resulting force fields reproduce forces calculated using the ab initio MP2 and the Kohn-Sham density functional theory with the Becke-Lee-Yang-Parr (BLYP) and Becke three-parameter LYP (B3LYP) exchange correlation functionals. The AFM force fields generated in this work are very simple to evaluate and are supported by most molecular dynamics (MD) codes. At the same time, the quality of the forces predicted by the AFM force fields rivals that of very expensive ab initio calculations and are found to successfully reproduce many experimental properties. The site-site radial distribution functions (RDFs) obtained from MD simulations using the force field generated from the BLYP functional through AFM compare favorably with the previously published RDFs from Car-Parrinello MD simulations with the same functional. Technical aspects of AFM such as the optimal QM cluster size, optimal basis set, and optimal QM method to be used with the AFM procedure are discussed in this paper.},

abstract = {We examine the ability of two-stage free-energy perturbation methods to yield solid-phase free energies using a system of harmonically coupled particles as a reference. We consider two ways to construct a reference system, one based on derivatives of the intermolecular potential of the target system of interest (the conventional choice in lattice dynamics), and the other based on analysis of pairwise configurational correlations observed in simulations of the target system. For each case, we consider two perturbation techniques that compute the free energy difference between the target and reference systems while avoiding lengthy thermodynamic integration procedures. The methods are overlap sampling as optimized by Bennett, and umbrella sampling optimized in a similar fashion. Such methods require at most two simulations to yield a result, but they can fail if the target and reference do not share a sufficiently large set of relevant configurations. In particular, failure can be expected for large systems, and we examine the question of how large a system can be before this point is reached. Our test case is a face-centered cubic system of r(-12) soft spheres, and we find that for systems of up to 108 particles the methods are accurate for all temperatures up to melting; for systems of 256 particles the methods begin to break down at about half the melting temperature. Significantly, we observe that the correction to the harmonic reference is only weakly dependent on system size, suggesting an N-hybrid technique in which perturbation is applied to a small system and the result added to a large-system harmonic reference to obtain a good estimate of the correct large-system free energy. We also examine these approaches, along with thermodynamic integration in temperature, with respect to their computational efficiency. We find that Bennett's method using a derivative-based harmonic reference is the most efficient of all those examined, particularly when employed in the N-hybrid method.},

An ab initio conformational analysis study found that barbituric acid can change its envelope conformation by over 20degrees from planar with a small energy change that can be compensated for by packing forces, so that the new Form ii is predicted to have a lower lattice energy than Form i. A computational search for minima in the lattice energy found many hypothetical structures of barbituric acid within the energy range of possible polymorphism, with a variety of hydrogen bonding acceptors and motifs. The search was found to be very sensitive to the assumed molecular structure of barbituric acid, so further plausible low energy variations in the molecular conformation would produce even more low energy crystal structures. Thus, the combined experimental and theoretical studies show that barbituric acid can pack in such a variety of low energy structures that further polymorphs seem possible.},

abstract = {A general method for detailed study of enzymic reactions is presented. The method considers the complete enzyme-substrate complex together with the surrounding solvent and evaluates all the different quantum mechanical and classical energy factors that can affect the reaction pathway. These factors include the quantum mechanical energies associated with bond cleavage and charge redistribution of the substrate and the classical energies of steric and electrostatic interactions between the substrate and the enzyme. The electrostatic polarization of the enzyme atoms and the orientation of the dipoles of the surrounding water molecules is simulated by a microscopic dielectric model. The solvation energy resulting from this polarization is considerable and must be included in any realistic calculation of chemical reactions involving anything more than an isolated molecule in vacuo. Without it, acidic groups can never become ionized and the charge distribution on the substrate will not be reasonable. The same dielectric model can also be used to study the reaction of the substrate in solution. In this way the reaction in solution can be compared with the enzymic reaction. In this paper we study the stability of the carbonium ion intermediate formed in the cleavage of a glycosidic bond by lysozyme. It is found that electrostatic stabilization is an important factor in increasing the rate of the reaction step that leads to the formation of the carbonium ion intermediate. Steric factors, such as the strain of the substrate on binding to lysozyme, do not seem to contribute significantly.},

The recently introduced AMOEBA force field is a leading publicly available example of this next generation of theoretical model, but to date, it has only received relatively limited validation, which we address here. We show that the AMOEBA force field is in fact a significant improvement over fixed charge models for small molecule structural and thermodynamic observables in particular, although further fine-tuning is necessary to describe solvation free energies of drug-like small molecules, dynamical properties away from ambient conditions, and possible improvements in aromatic interactions. State of the art electronic structure calculations reveal generally very good agreement with AMOEBA for demanding problems such as relative conformational energies of the alanine tetrapeptide and isomers of water sulfate complexes. AMOEBA is shown to be especially successful on protein-ligand binding and computational X-ray crystallography where polarization and accurate electrostatics are critical.},

The computational tools for this task are a polymorph generator and the PIXEL density sums method for the calculation of intermolecular energies. From this perspective, the molecular recognition, crystal packing, and solid-state phase behavior of caffeine and several methylxanthines (purine-2,6-diones) have been analyzed. Many possible crystal structures for anhydrous caffeine have been generated by computer simulation, and the most stable among them is a thermodynamic, ordered equivalent of the disordered phase, revealed by powder X-ray crystallography. Molecular recognition energies between two caffeine molecules or between caffeine and water have been calculated, and the results reveal the largely predominant mode to be the stacking of parallel caffeine molecules, an intermediately favorable caffeine-water interaction, and many other equivalent energy minima for lateral interactions of much less stabilization power. This last indetermination helps to explain why caffeine does not crystallize easily into an ordered anhydrous structure. In contrast, the mono- and dimethylxanthines (theophylline, theobromine, and the 1,7-isomer, for which we present a single-crystal X-ray study and a lattice energy landscape) do crystallize in anhydrous form thanks to the formation of lateral hydrogen bonds.},

In addition, strategies for treating the contact region of QM and MM atoms as well as enzyme and solvent environments are developed. Two levels of ab initio calculations are used in studying the QM atoms: the HF/4-31G method, which allows calculations on a large number of points while still giving accurate results, and the MP2/6-31+G* approach. The QM(ai)/MM method is implemented and examined by simulating the nucleophilic attack step in the catalytic reaction of subtilisin. It is found that the use of the EVB potential as a reference allows one to obtain the actual ab initio activation free energies of enzymatic reactions. Possible powerful simplifications such as the use of the ab initio intermolecular electrostatic energy are discussed, and the advantage of focusing on the difference between the reaction in protein and solution is demonstrated.},

There were 14 research groups which took part, using a variety of methods to generate and rank the most likely crystal structures for four target systems: three single-component crystal structures and a 1:1 cocrystal. Participants were challenged to predict the crystal structures of the four systems, given only their molecular diagrams, while the recently determined but as-yet unpublished crystal structures were withheld by an independent referee. Three predictions were allowed for each system. The results demonstrate a dramatic improvement in rates of success over previous blind tests; in total, there were 13 successful predictions and, for each of the four targets, at least two groups correctly predicted the observed crystal structure. The successes include one participating group who correctly predicted all four crystal structures as their first ranked choice, albeit at a considerable computational expense. The results reflect important improvements in modelling methods and suggest that, at least for the small and fairly rigid types of molecules included in this blind test, such calculations can be constructively applied to help understand crystallization and polymorphism of organic molecules.},

abstract = {Reliable studies of enzymatic reactions by combined quantum mechanical/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) approaches, with an ab initio description of the quantum region, presents a major challenge to computational chemists. The main problem is the need for a large amount of computer time to evaluate the QM energy, which in turn makes it extremely challenging to perform proper configurational sampling. This work presents major progress toward the evaluation of ab initio QM/MM free-energy surfaces and activation free energies of reactions in enzymes and in solutions. This is done by exploiting our previous idea of using the empirical valence bond (EVB) method as a reference potential and then using the linear response approximation (LRA) approach to evaluate the free energies of transfer from the EVB to the QM/MM surfaces in the reactant and product state. However, the new crucial step involves the use of a constraint at the transition state that fixes the system at a given value of the reaction coordinate and allows us to use the LRA at the transition state. The advance offered by the present approach is particularly significant because it evaluates the free energy associated with both the substrate and the solvent motions. This evaluation appeared to be a relatively simple task once one uses a classical reference potential. The main problem has been using the reference potential for the evaluation of the free-energy contributions associated with the solute motions where the difference between the reference EVB potential and the QM/MM potential can be large. The present refinement finally allows us to overcome the problems with the solute fluctuations and therefore to obtain, for the first time, a free-energy barrier that reflects the solute entropy properly. Thus, we present a way to evaluate the complete QM/MM activation free energy with an equal footing treatment of the solute and the solvent. This provides a general consistent and effective strategy for evaluating the QM/MM activation free energies in proteins and in solution. Our advance allows one to explore consistently various mechanistic and catalytic proposals while using ab initio (ai) QM/MM approaches.},

annote = {This paper is interested in Aqueous electrolyte solubility. The authors seeks to calculate this solubility using computational simulations.

Recent simulations using common FF have precipitation well below the experimental solubility limit. Force Fields are generally parametrized at infinite dilution, so their use at higher concentrations is questionable.

Most simulations have used nonpolarizable FFs. Solubility is determined by calculating the chemical potential and seeing where the crystal and liquid intersect. 

Various previous efforts have a 1 order of magnitude difference in molality at precipitation. Here the results are compared against the gibbs-duhem equation to show that their results are mutually consistent.

The chemical potential of nonpolarizable models are more accurate at low concentrations, and the polarizable model is more accurate at high concentrations. 

The nonpolarizable FF produces a much better solid chemical potential than the polarizable models.

In conclusion, the polarizable models do not give a better solubility than the non-polarizable models, but this effect is mainly due to the solid phase calculation. The solvent phase has a more accurate chemical potential relative to the experiments with the polarizable models.},

abstract = {In this paper a new method to evaluate the free energy of solids is proposed. The method can be regarded as a variant of the method proposed by Frenkel and Ladd [J. Chem. Phys. 81, 3188 (1984)]. The main equations of the method can be derived in a simple way. The method can be easily implemented within a Monte Carlo program. We have applied the method to determine the free energy of hard spheres in the solid phase for several system sizes. The obtained free energies agree within the numerical uncertainty with those obtained by Polson et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 112, 5339 (2000)]. The fluid-solid equilibria has been determined for several system sizes and compared to the values published previously by Wilding and Bruce [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 5138 (2000)] using the phase switch methodology. It is shown that both the free energies and the coexistence pressures present a strong size dependence and that the results obtained from free energy calculations agree with those obtained using the phase switch method, which constitutes a cross-check of both methodologies. From the results of this work we estimate the coexistence pressure of the fluid-solid transition of hard spheres in the thermodynamic limit to be p*=11.54(4), which is slightly lower than the classical value of Hoover and Ree (p*=11.70) [J. Chem. Phys. 49, 3609 (1968)]. Taking into account the strong size dependence of the free energy of the solid phase, we propose to introduce finite size corrections, which allow us to estimate approximately the free energy of the solid phase in the thermodynamic limit from the known value of the free energy of the solid phase with N molecules. We have also determined the free energy of a Lennard-Jones solid by using both the methodology of this work and the finite size correction. It is shown how a relatively good estimate of the free energy of the system in the thermodynamic limit is obtained even from the free energy of a relatively small system.},

abstract = {This paper reports a novel methodology for the free-energy minimization of crystal structures exhibiting strong, anisotropic interactions due to hydrogen bonding. The geometry of the thermally expanded cell was calculated by exploiting the dependence of the free-energy derivatives with respect to cell lengths and angles on the average pressure tensor computed in short molecular dynamics simulations. All dynamic simulations were performed with an elaborate anisotropic potential based on a distributed multipole analysis of the isolated molecule charge density. Changes in structure were monitored via simulated X-ray diffraction patterns. The methodology was used to minimize the free energy at ambient conditions of a set of experimental and hypothetical 5-fluorouracil crystal structures, generated in a search for lattice-energy minima with the same model potential. Our results demonstrate that the majority ( approximately 75{\%}) of lattice-energy minima are thermally stable at ambient conditions, and hence, the free-energy (like the lattice-energy) surface is complex and highly undulating. Metadynamics trajectories (Laio, A.; Parrinello, M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2002, 99, 12562) started from the free-energy minima only produced transitions that preserved the hydrogen-bonding motif, and thus, further developments are needed for this method to efficiently explore such free-energy surfaces. The existence of so many free-energy minima, with large barriers for the alteration of the hydrogen-bonding motif, is consistent with the range of motifs observed in crystal structures of 5-fluorouracil and other 5-substituted uracils.},

abstract = {THE RELIABILITY OF FREE ENERGY SIMULATIONS (FES) IS LIMITED BY TWO FACTORS: (a) the need for correct sampling and (b) the accuracy of the computational method employed. Classical methods (e.g., force fields) are typically used for FES and present a myriad of challenges, with parametrization being a principle one. On the other hand, parameter-free quantum mechanical (QM) methods tend to be too computationally expensive for adequate sampling. One widely used approach is a combination of methods, where the free energy difference between the two end states is computed by, e.g., molecular mechanics (MM), and the end states are corrected by more accurate methods, such as QM or hybrid QM/MM techniques. Here we report two new approaches that significantly improve the aforementioned scheme; with a focus on how to compute corrections between, e.g., the MM and the more accurate QM calculations. First, a molecular dynamics trajectory that properly samples relevant conformational degrees of freedom is generated. Next, potential energies of each trajectory frame are generated with a QM or QM/MM Hamiltonian. Free energy differences are then calculated based on the QM or QM/MM energies using either a non-Boltzmann Bennett approach (QM-NBB) or non-Boltzmann free energy perturbation (NB-FEP). Both approaches are applied to calculate relative and absolute solvation free energies in explicit and implicit solvent environments. Solvation free energy differences (relative and absolute) between ethane and methanol in explicit solvent are used as the initial test case for QM-NBB. Next, implicit solvent methods are employed in conjunction with both QM-NBB and NB-FEP to compute absolute solvation free energies for 21 compounds. These compounds range from small molecules such as ethane and methanol to fairly large, flexible solutes, such as triacetyl glycerol. Several technical aspects were investigated. Ultimately some best practices are suggested for improving methods that seek to connect MM to QM (or QM/MM) levels of theory in FES.},

abstract = {We examine a method for computing the change in free energy with temperature of a crystalline solid. In the method, the free-energy difference between nearby temperatures is calculated via overlap-sampling free-energy perturbation with Bennett's optimization. Coupled to this is a harmonically targeted perturbation that displaces the atoms in a manner consistent with the temperature change, such that for a harmonic system, the free-energy difference would be recovered with no error. A series of such perturbations can be assembled to bridge larger gaps in temperature. We test this harmonically targeted temperature perturbation (HTTP) method through the application to the inverse-power soft potential, u(r)=$\epsilon$($\sigma$/r)(n), over a range of temperatures up to the melting condition. Three exponent values (n=12, 9, and 6) for the potential are studied with different crystal structures, specifically face-centered cubic (fcc), body-centered cubic (bcc), and hexagonal close packing. Absolute free energies (classical only) for each system are obtained by implementing the series to near-zero temperature, where the harmonic model becomes very accurate. The HTTP method is shown to provide very precise results, with errors in the free energy smaller than two parts in 10(5). An analysis of the thermodynamic stability of the various structures in the infinite-system limit confirms previous findings. In particular, for n=12 and 9, the fcc structure is stable for all temperatures up to melting, and for n=6, the bcc crystal becomes stable relative to fcc for temperatures above kT/$\epsilon$=0.802±0.001. The effects of vacancies and other defects are not considered in the analysis.},

Analysis of the effect of solvent on the initial aggregation of 5-fluorouracil molecules shows that the strong binding of water to the 5-fluorouracil molecule hinders the formation of the doubly hydrogen-bonded dimer and, by default, promotes close hydrophobic F...F interactions that are a feature of the unusual (Z' = 4) structure of form I. In contrast, doubly hydrogen-bonded dimers are observed to form readily in solution in dry nitromethane, consistent with the crystallization of the doubly hydrogen-bonded ribbon structure of form II from this solvent. When nitromethane is doped with water, the water forms hydrogen bonds to the solute, interfering with the formation of the doubly hydrogen-bonded dimers, which is consistent with the crystallization of form I from this hygroscopic solvent when it is not dried. Overall, the molecular dynamics simulations provide an atomistic picture of how solvent-solute interactions can significantly affect the initial association of 5-fluorouracil molecules to the extent that they determine the polymorphic outcome of the crystallization.},

A rigorous test of the ability to converge such calculations would be very useful in this context. In this work, we perform a direct assessment of the convergence of the MM to QM perturbation, by attempting the reverse QM to MM perturbation. This required the generation of extensive QM molecular dynamics trajectories, using density functional theory (DFT), within the representative biological system of a DNA adenosine-thymidine dimer. Over 100 ps of dynamics with the PBE functional and 6.25 ps with the LDA functional were generated. We demonstrate that calculations with total potential energies are very poorly convergent due to a lack of overlap of phase space distributions between ensembles. While not theoretically rigorous, the use of interaction energies provides far superior convergence, despite the presence of nonclassical charge transfer effects within the DFT trajectories. The source of poor phase space overlap for total energies is diagnosed, the approximate quantification of overlaps suggesting that even for the comparatively simple system considered here convergence of total energy calculations within a reasonable simulation time is unfeasible.},

abstract = {A method recently developed to rigorously determine solid-liquid equilibrium using a free-energy-based analysis has been extended to analyze multiatom molecular systems. This method is based on using a pseudosupercritical transformation path to reversibly transform between solid and liquid phases. Integration along this path yields the free energy difference at a single state point, which can then be used to determine the free energy difference as a function of temperature and therefore locate the coexistence temperature at a fixed pressure. The primary extension reported here is the introduction of an external potential field capable of inducing center of mass order along with secondary orientational order for molecules. The method is used to calculate the melting point of 1-H-1,2,4-triazole and benzene. Despite the fact that the triazole model gives accurate bulk densities for the liquid and crystal phases, it is found to do a poor job of reproducing the experimental crystal structure and heat of fusion. Consequently, it yields a melting point that is 100 K lower than the experimental value. On the other hand, the benzene model has been parametrized extensively to match a wide range of properties and yields a melting point that is only 20 K lower than the experimental value. Previous work in which a simple "direct heating" method was used actually found that the melting point of the benzene model was 50 K higher than the experimental value. This demonstrates the importance of using proper free energy methods to compute phase behavior. It also shows that the melting point is a very sensitive measure of force field quality that should be considered in parametrization efforts. The method described here provides a relatively simple approach for computing melting points of molecular systems.},

This report provides characterization of the two polymorphs and the structures and hydrogen bonding network for each form. METHODS: Ritonavir polymorphism was investigated using solid state spectroscopy and microscopy techniques including solid state NMR, Near Infrared Spectroscopy, powder X-ray Diffraction and Single crystal X-ray. A sensitive seed detection test was developed. RESULTS: Ritonavir polymorphs were thoroughly characterized and the structures determined. An unusual conformation was found for form II that results in a strong hydrogen bonding network A possible mechanism for heterogeneous nucleation of form II was investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Ritonavir was found to exhibit conformational polymorphism with two unique crystal lattices having significantly different solubility properties. Although the polymorph (form II) corresponding to the "cis" conformation is a more stable packing arrangement, nucleation, even in the presence of form II seeds, is energetically unfavored except in highly supersaturated solutions. The coincidence of a highly supersaturated solution and a probable heterogeneous nucleation by a degradation product resulted in the sudden appearance of the more stable form II polymorph.},

abstract = {An important unsolved problem in materials science is prediction of the thermodynamic stability of organic crystals and their solubility from first principles. Solubility can be defined as the saturating concentration of a molecule within a liquid solvent, where the physical picture is of solvated molecules in equilibrium with their solid phase. Despite the importance of solubility in determining the oral bioavailability of pharmaceuticals, prediction tools are currently limited to quantitative structure-property relationships that are fit to experimental solubility measurements. For the first time, we describe a consistent procedure for the prediction of the structure, thermodynamic stability and solubility of organic crystals from molecular dynamics simulations using the polarizable multipole AMOEBA force field. Our approach is based on a thermodynamic cycle that decomposes standard state solubility into the sum of solid-vapor sublimation and vapor-liquid solvation free energies [Formula: see text], which are computed via the orthogonal space random walk (OSRW) sampling strategy. Application to the n-alkylamides series from aeetamide through octanamide was selected due to the dependence of their solubility on both amide hydrogen bonding and the hydrophobic effect, which are each fundamental to protein structure and solubility. On average, the calculated absolute standard state solubility free energies are accurate to within 1.1 kcal/mol. The experimental trend of decreasing solubility as a function of n-alkylamide chain length is recapitulated by the increasing stability of the crystalline state and to a lesser degree by decreasing favorability of solvation (i.e. the hydrophobic effect). Our results suggest that coupling the polarizable AMOEBA force field with an orthogonal space based free energy algorithm, as implemented in the program Force Field X, is a consistent procedure for predicting the structure, thermodynamic stability and solubility of organic crystals.},

The most stable (global minimum) structure provides a prediction of an experimental crystal structure. However, depending on the specific molecule, there may be other structures which are very close in energy. In this case, the other structures on the crystal energy landscape may be polymorphs, components of static or dynamic disorder in observed structures, or there may be no route to nucleating and growing these structures. A major reason for performing CSP studies is as a complement to solid form screening to see which alternative packings to the known polymorphs are thermodynamically feasible.},

The lattice energy involves many small contributions,all of which must be converged to high accuracy. 

Three main advances allow the improvement in lattice energy accuracy. (1) Local correction methods reduce the cost of quantum chemistry methods. (2) arbitrary-order DMRG methods enable the description of high-order quantum chemical correlations.

Generally, the experimental structures were maintained very well. Calculated packing energies were in good agreement with experimental heats of sublimation. For flexible molecules, change of the molecular charge distribution with conformation was seen to be important. Secondly, crystal structure predictions were performed for methanol, ethanol, 1,4-dioxane, and propane. For methanol the experimental structure corresponded to the most favorable structure with one independent molecule, although a few structures with two independent molecules had a marginally lower energy. In the case of ethanol the experimental structure, which contains two independent molecules, was among the best ones, but in this case three structures with one independent molecule were slightly more favorable. For dioxane the high- and the low-temperature phase were predicted with low energy, but in the wrong order. The experimental structure of propane was predicted correctly: it corresponded to the most favorable structure in our ab initio potential. In all cases the predictions using the ab initio potentials were superior to predictions based on standard force fields.},

Here, first-principles calculations provide an alternative explanation based on free-energy differences at room temperature. The explicit consideration of many-body van der Waals interactions in the free energy demonstrates that the stability of the most abundant form of aspirin is due to a subtle coupling between collective electronic fluctuations and quantized lattice vibrations. In addition, a systematic analysis of the elastic properties of the two forms of aspirin rules out mechanical instability of form II as making it metastable.},

Terahertz spectroscopy readily distinguished between the isostructural cocrystals of theophylline with chiral and racemic forms of malic acid which are almost identical in molecular structure and supramolecular architecture. Similarly, the cocrystals of theophylline with chiral and racemic forms of tartaric acid, which are similar at the molecular level but dissimilar in crystal packing, were distinguished unequivocally. The investigation of the same cocrystals using X-ray powder diffraction and Raman spectroscopy suggested that THz-TDS is comparable in sensitivity to diffraction methods and more sensitive than Raman spectroscopy to changes in cocrystal architecture. The differences in spectra acquired by THz-TDS could be further enhanced by cooling the samples to 109 K.},

If intramolecular DOF are treated with QM, the lowest energy configurations all have low intramolecular energies and poor intermolecular energies, however the real crystal structure had low intermolecular DOF. Including polarizability in the intermolecular energies is an attempt to correct this imbalance.

abstract = {A rigorous and generally applicable method for computing solid-liquid coexistence is presented. The method overcomes some of the technical difficulties associated with other solid-liquid simulation procedures and can be implemented within either a molecular dynamics or Monte Carlo framework. The method consists of three steps: First, relative Gibbs free energy curves are created for the solid and liquid phases using histogram reweighting. Next, the free energy difference between the solid and liquid phases is evaluated at a single state point by integrating along a pseudosupercritical transformation path that connects the two phases. Using this result, the solid and liquid free energy curves are referenced to a common point, allowing a single coexistence point to be determined. Finally, Gibbs-Duhem integration is used to determine the full coexistence curve. To evaluate its utility, this method is applied to the Lennard-Jones and NaCl systems. Results for solid-liquid coexistence agree with previous calculations for these systems. In addition, it is shown that the NaCl model does not correctly describe solid-liquid coexistence at high pressures. An analysis of the accuracy of the method indicates that the results are most sensitive to the transformation free energy calculation.},

The 17 participants were given only the chemical diagram for three organic molecules and were invited to test their prediction programs within a range of named common space groups. Several different computer programs were used, using the methodology wherein a molecular model is used to construct theoretical crystal structures in given space groups, and prediction is usually based on the minimum calculated lattice energy. A maximum of three predictions were allowed per molecule. The results showed two correct predictions for the first molecule, four for the second molecule and none for the third molecule (which had torsional flexibility). The correct structure was often present in the sorted low-energy lists from the participants but at a ranking position greater than three. The use of non-indexed powder diffraction data was investigated in a secondary test, after completion of the ab initio submissions. Although no one method can be said to be completely reliable, this workshop gives an objective measure of the success and failure of current methodologies.},

Zwanzig reweighting is bad when the overlap is bad. This can be observe by 'jumps' in the free energy estimate as the amount of sampling is increased.

MM generally has poor phase space overlap with QM. To avoid this, configurations can be generated with MM + a Monte Carlo accept/reject step based on a QM/MM hamiltonian.

Run an MD simulation, then accept or reject the final configuration in to the QM/MM ensemble, then randomize the velocities and redo the MD simulation.

A number of MM simulations are run with different lambda values, and at each intermediate, the configurations are accepted based on the QM/MM energy and the lambda value. The free energy to go from MM to QM/MM is then calculated using TI. This generated an ensemble in QM/MM while avoiding the need to simulate within QM/MM.

Note, this will still bias the system by only exploring configurations that the MM hamiltonian explores.

Free energy vs Sampling is used to measure convergence of the fep method.},

annote = {Crystal structure prediction assists in the design of materials with novel properties as well as the avoidance of undesirable change of form in the later stages of industrial development.

The structure of the crytal is the necessary starting point for understanding and predicting its physico-chemical properties.

In the literature up to 2004, most of the research focused on methods and example systems.

An overwhelming majority of crystals fall in to the packing factor of 0.65-0.75

Crystal structure prediction relies on two areas: generating all possible packings, and accurately calculating the energy of those structures.

Changes between molecules are often much larger than changes within molecules (bonds, angles etc).

In the early days, hypothetical alternatives to known crystal structures were derived from the packing of similar molecules.

One can search for the energy minima by making a grid of M points along each N degree of freedom, for M{\^{}}N total calculations. The unit cell has 6 DOF and each molecule has 6 DOF. One could also generate a random set of configurations varying these degrees of freedom, though reliably covering all of the relevant phase space can become an issue.

To accelerate this search, one can generate structures based on the known symmetry space groups. This, of course, has the potential to miss certain structures outside these space groups.

Configurations can also be generated using Monte Carlo searches combined with simulated annealing. 

Metadynamics is typically used for MD searches to predict new crystal structures (since unbiased MD becomes kinetically trapped). The free energy surface tends to be smoother than the lattice energy surface. In the case of benzene, all known polymorphs are found as free energy minima, and unobserved energy minima go away.

Most CSP methods focus on small rigid molecules. The variations to do non-rigid molecules can lead to differences of {\~{}}4 kJ/mol.

In many molecules, there are 'soft' degrees of freedom where a 20 degree rotation is permitted. The rigid molecule approach will not work here. For example, the molecule biphenyl has a 45 degree twist in the gas phase, but prefers to be planar as a crystal.

80{\%} of homomolecular organic crystal structures have either one or a fraction of a molecule in the asymmetric unit in one of the six space groups.

One way to search for polymorphs (in comercial programs) is a simulated annealing algorithm which invokes monte carlo moves on the crystal. It is recommended that this be done multiple times to ensure convergence.},

The approach involves treating the molecule as a set of linked rigid units, whose conformational energy is expressed as a function of the relative orientations of the rigid groups. The conformational energy is calculated by electronic structure methods and the intermolecular interactions using an atomic multipole description of electrostatics. A key consideration in our approach is the scalability to more typical pharmaceutical molecules of higher molecular weight with many more atoms and degrees of flexibility.

We have therefore performed a systematic crystal structure prediction search for minima in the lattice energy of crystalline paracetamol. The stable monoclinic form is found as the global lattice-energy minimum, but there are at least a dozen energetically feasible structures found, including the well-characterized metastable orthorhombic phase. Hence, we require additional criteria to reduce the number of hypothetical crystal structures that can be considered as potential polymorphs. For this purpose the elastic properties and vapor growth morphology of the known and predicted structures have been estimated using second-derivative analysis and the attachment-energy model. These inexpensive calculations give reasonable agreement with the available experimental data for the known polymorphs. Some of the hypothetical structures are predicted to have a low growth rate and plate-like morphology, and so are unlikely to be observed. Another is only marginally mechanically stable. Thus, this first consideration of such properties in a crystal-structure prediction study appears to reduce the number of predicted polymorphs while leaving a few candidates for the uncharacterized form.},

abstract = {The problem of predicting polymorphism in atomic and molecular crystals constitutes a significant challenge both experimentally and theoretically. From the theoretical viewpoint, polymorphism prediction falls into the general class of problems characterized by an underlying rough energy landscape, and consequently, free energy based enhanced sampling approaches can be brought to bear on the problem. In this paper, we build on a scheme previously introduced by two of the authors in which the lengths and angles of the supercell are targeted for enhanced sampling via temperature accelerated adiabatic free energy dynamics [T. Q. Yu and M. E. Tuckerman, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 015701 (2011)]. Here, that framework is expanded to include general order parameters that distinguish different crystalline arrangements as target collective variables for enhanced sampling. The resulting free energy surface, being of quite high dimension, is nontrivial to reconstruct, and we discuss one particular strategy for performing the free energy analysis. The method is applied to the study of polymorphism in xenon crystals at high pressure and temperature using the Steinhardt order parameters without and with the supercell included in the set of collective variables. The expected fcc and bcc structures are obtained, and when the supercell parameters are included as collective variables, we also find several new structures, including fcc states with hcp stacking faults. We also apply the new method to the solid-liquid phase transition in copper at 1300 K using the same Steinhardt order parameters. Our method is able to melt and refreeze the system repeatedly, and the free energy profile can be obtained with high efficiency.},

abstract = {Lately, there has been great interest in performing free-energy perturbation (FEP) at the combined quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics (QM/MM) level, e.g. for enzyme reactions. Such calculations require extensive sampling of phase space, which typically is prohibitive with density-functional theory or ab initio methods. Therefore, such calculations have mostly been performed with semiempirical QM (SQM) methods, or by using a thermodynamic cycle involving sampling at the MM level and perturbations between the MM and QM/MM levels of theory. However, the latter perturbations typically have convergence problems, unless the QM system is kept fixed during the simulations, because the MM and QM/MM descriptions of the internal degrees of freedom inside the QM system are too dissimilar. We have studied whether the convergence of the MM → QM/MM perturbation can be improved by using a thoroughly parameterised force field or by using SQM/MM methods. As a test case we use the first half-reaction of haloalkane dehalogenase and the QM calculations are performed with the PBE, B3LYP, and TPSSH density-functional methods. We show that the convergence can be improved with a tailored force field, but only locally around the parameterised state. Simulations based on SQM/MM methods using the MNDO, AM1, PM3, RM1, PDDG-MNDO, and PDDG-PM3 Hamiltonians have slightly better convergence properties, but very long simulations are still needed ({\~{}}10 ns) and convergence is obtained only if electrostatic interactions between the QM system and the surroundings are ignored. This casts some doubts on the common practice to base QM/MM FEPs on semiempirical simulations without any reweighting of the trajectories.},

abstract = {We present a molecular simulation protocol to compute free energies of binding, which combines a QM/MM correction term with rigorous classical free energy techniques, thereby accounting for electronic polarization effects. Relative free energies of binding are first computed using classical force fields, Monte Carlo sampling, and replica exchange thermodynamic integration. Snapshots of the configurations at the end points of the perturbation are then subjected to DFT-QM/MM single-point calculations using the B3LYP functional and a range of basis sets. The resulting quantum mechanical energies are then processed using the Zwanzig equation to give free energies incorporating electronic polarization. Our approach is conceptually simple and does not require tightly coupled QM and MM software. The method has been validated by calculating the relative free energies of hydration of methane and water and the relative free energy of binding of two inhibitors of cyclooxygenase-2. Closed thermodynamic cycles are obtained across different pathways, demonstrating the correctness of the technique, although significantly more sampling is required for the protein-ligand system. Our method offers a simple and effective way to incorporate quantum mechanical effects into computed free energies of binding.},
annote = {Scoring Functions attempt to relate experimentlally determined binding affinities to calculated properties of the protein-ligand complex.


Rigorous free energy calculations in principle allow an exact computation of the binding free energy.


Free energy calculations will be off if polarization exists in the system but is not considered in the hamiltonian. In some cases, polarization can be considered by overstimating the solute gas-pase charges. 


Reweighting can also be done by generating configurations in MM and then accepting or rejecting the configurations by calculating the QM/MM Energy along with a metropolis algorithm.


Previous studies have shown that adding QM/MM corrections have led to a decrease in accuracy. Perhaps this is due to no back-polarization?


To validate this approach, the free energy difference is calculated using multiple alternative pathways to confirm that the answer is the same. This is done because sampling in the expensive potential is not possible.

The fact that both pathways give the same answer suggests that this perturbation in one step is reasonable. 

An 'ideal' charge perturbation could be done in which the free energy difference between the point-charge and polarizable model is zero.},
