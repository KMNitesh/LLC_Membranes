\chapter{Chemically Selective Transport in the H\textsubscript{II} Phase}\label{chapter:transport}

  \section{Introduction}

  Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can give us mechanistic insights with
  atomistic resolution so that we can provide detailed descriptions of small
  solute transport within LLC membrane nanopores and intelligently design new
  membranes for solute-specific separations. In our previous work, we used MD
  simulations to determine the most likely structure of the hexagonal phase
  formed by the monomer Na-GA3C11, expanding upon the most recent experimental
  characterization.~\cite{coscia_understanding_2019,feng_thin_2016} We developed
  techniques to simulate the hexagonal phase formed by neat monomer as well as
  with varying amounts of water in the pores.
 
  In this work, we present studies of the transport mechanisms exhibited by 20
  uncharged polar solutes with varying size, chemical functionality and
  hydrophilic character within the pores of an H\textsubscript{II} phase LLC
  membrane. The pores of the H\textsubscript{II} phase have a similar topology to
  the Q\textsubscript{I} phase but their geometry is simpler to model. In future
  studies, we will extend our techniques to the Q\textsubscript{I} phase. 

  Figure~\ref{fig:membrane_rendering} shows an atomistic rendering of the
  membrane in which we placed solutes. We have listed the solutes studied along
  with the abbreviations that we will use in the charts for the remainder of this
  paper in Table~\ref{table:abbreviations}. Note that, in order limit our
  studies to uncharged species, we have only studied acetic acid in its
  protonated form. The pKa of gallic acid is 4.40 while the pKa of acetic acid is
  4.75.~\cite{chuysinuan_gallic_2009,perrin_pka_1981} Assuming that the pKa of
  gallic acid is similar to Na-GA3C11, it is possible for our sodium salted
  monomer to exist at the same time as protonated acetic acid. In any case, we
  are more interested in mechanisms of interaction with specific chemical
  functionality more than the behavior of specific molecules.

  We begin our analysis by studying the structure of the membrane nanopores.
  Previously, we studied dry membrane systems and some systems with low water
  content. We showed that those systems have rather crowded pores with high
  concentrations of monomer head groups, sodium ions and water, where applicable.
  Here we build systems with appreciable amounts of water, 5 and 10\% by weight,
  and analyze how the radial density of monomer components and water change
  compared to our previous results.
 
  We then use the transport rates of water in and out of the pores in order to
  to justify our study of solute transport restricted to the pore region. From a 
  macroscopic perspective, it might make sense to hypothesize that water spends its time 
  exclusively in the tube-like hydrophilic pore region. Our previous work showed
  that there is a gradual compositional transition from the hydrophilic to the
  hydrophobic region which means that solutes may not necessarily stay confined
  to the centers of the pores or even within the pore region. We show that, in 
  our most viable system, water moves fastest within the pores suggesting that 
  the area in and around the central pores should be the focus of our mechanistic studies.

  In the remainder of the paper, we describe and quantify three trapping 
  mechanisms which give rise to subdiffusive solute transport behavior
  %BJCF: added
  on timescales of hundreds of nanoseconds. 
  We describe the differences in solute motion, specifically their mean
  squared displacement (MSD), in conjunction with each solute's size and 
  chemical functionality. We show how distinct interactions with various
  monomer components as well as membrane water content hinders the motion 
  of solutes. We discuss how the interactions between specific solutes and
  the membrane depend on the solute's chemical functionality.

  There are also several questions beyond the scope of this study.
  First, we will not study the concentration dependence of the observed transport
  rates. Although the average MSD might change with concentration, we are 
  focused on the underlying solute-membrane interactions that lead to the 
  observed transport mechanisms which we conjecture will remain roughly
  the same regardless of concentration. Second, we will not study the chemical potential
  of solutes in the pores, which could give us a better understanding of 
  equilibrium solute partitioning. However, this information is likely
  not needed to understand the principal mechanistic details in various membrane
  regions. This work instead represents a starting point for observing the 
  types of interactions that occur between isolated solutes and the membrane.

  \section{Methods}
  
  Python scripts used to set up systems and conduct post-simulation trajectory 
  analysis (as described below and in Appendix B) are available 
  online at \\
  \texttt{https://github.com/shirtsgroup/LLC\_Membranes}. The 
  appropriate scripts to use for the subsequent calculations are summarized in 
  Table~\ref{S-table:python_scripts_transport} of Appendix B. We ran all 
  MD simulations and energy minimizations using GROMACS 2018.3.~\cite{bekker_gromacs:_1993,berendsen_gromacs:_1995,van_der_spoel_gromacs:_2005,hess_gromacs_2008} 
  
  \subsection{Molecule Parameterization}\label{method:molecule_parameterization}
  
  We parameterized the interaction potential for the monomer and solutes using
  the General AMBER Force Field (GAFF)~\cite{wang_development_2004} with the
  Antechamber package \cite{wang_automatic_2006} shipped with
  AmberTools16~\cite{case_ambertools16_2016}. We use GAFF as it has been used
  extensively with organic molecules. We assigned atomic charges using the
  am1bccsym method of \texttt{molcharge} included with QUACPAC from OpenEye
  Scientific Software.
  
  We simulated water molecules using the TIP3P water model because it is the
  water model that GAFF and other AMBER family parameters have been optimized
  with.~\cite{florova_explicit_2010,ponder_force_2003}
  
  \subsection{System Setup}\label{method:system_setup}

  Stable H\textsubscript{II} phases, assembled with monomer Na-GA3C11, can be formed
  using a broad range of water concentrations. In the literature, the system 
  studied in this work is typically synthesized with close to 10 wt\% water.
  \cite{smith_ordered_1997, zhou_new_2007} However, Resel et al. noted that the
  system is likely fully hydrated with less than 7 wt\% water.~\cite{resel_h2-phase_2000}
  Excess water fills space between hexagonal mesophases. We decided to test 
  systems with two different water contents: 5 and 10 wt\%.
  
  We initially attempted to equilibrate our system with water by allowing water
  molecules to naturally penetrate the membrane from a water bath separating
  periodic images of the system in the $z$-direction. We allowed a dry, previously
  equilibrated system to further equilibrate in coexistence with a 3 nm-thick 
  (in the $z$-direction) layer of water. Although the water appears to equilibrate
  after 1000 ns of simulation, the density of water along the pore axis
  is close to zero at the membrane center, implying that there is a kinetic
  barrier to water filling the pores which we will be unable to overcome using
  conventional simulations. See Section~\ref{S-section:water_content_equil} 
  of Appendix B for an expanded explanation and supporting figures. 
	  
  We observed that water enters into the distal tail region of our system. We
  define the distal tail region to be ca. 1.5 nm from the pore center based on
  the minimum in the radial distribution function of water (see
  Section~\ref{method:rdfs}). Therefore we aimed to build our initial
  configurations with water in both regions, close to the expected equilibrium
  partition. The final amount of water present in the distal tail region may or
  may not be experimentally consistent but it is necessary for our results to be
  thermodynamically consistent; otherwise, water would slowly leak from the pore
  into the tail region over several hundred nanoseconds. 
	
  To determine the approximate ratio of water in the pores to tails, we
  equilibrated 4 systems where we initially placed water in the pores and in the
  tails in addition to a water reservoir between periodic images. We filled the
  pores of our initial configuration with water by running the GROMACS command
  \texttt{gmx solvate} on our initial configuration followed by the removal of
  any water molecules placed in the distal tail region. This method requires that
  we vary the monomer starting radius since the vacant space dictates the pore's
  water content. We then placed a defined number of water molecules into the
  distal tail region one at a time with a short energy minimization between each
  insertion. We chose to test systems with initial pore radii of 5, 6, 7 and 8
  \AA~with tail and pore water compositions given in
  Table~\ref{S-table:water_content}. We found that systems started with more
  water in the pores than tails tended to equilibrate relatively quickly with an
  approximate ratio of 3 water molecules in the pores to 2 in the tails.

  We removed the water reservoir and allowed the pore and tail water contents
  to equilibrate with 5 and 10 wt\% total water with a 3:2 ratio of pore to tail
  water. We considered the water content equilibrated once the number of water
  molecules in each region plateaued. The 5 wt\% system did not plateau until
  $\sim$ 600 ns while the 10 wt \% water system equilibrated within the first 100
  ns of simulation (see Figure~\ref{S-fig:5wt_offset_equil} and
  Figure~\ref{S-fig:10wt_offset_equil} of Appendix B). The
  equilibrated pores contain 72 \% and 69 \% of the total water in the 5 and 10
  wt \% systems respectively. We cross-linked the equilibrated solvated systems,
  then allowed them to equilibrate further for 100 ns. The water contents in
  each region does not change significantly in either case (see
  Figure~\ref{S-fig:xlinked_solvation_equilibration} of Appendix B). The `wet' 
  equilibration and cross-linking procedures follow the
  methods outlined in our previous work.~\cite{coscia_understanding_2019}
  
  The equilibrated unit cells have different geometries depending on water
  content. The average distance between pores is 4.15 +/- 0.08 nm and 4.41 +/- 0.07 nm
  in the 5 and 10 wt\% water systems respectively. The length of the pores, accounting
  for tortuosity (see Section~\ref{method:rdfs}), is 9.03 +/- 0.12 nm and 8.07 +/- 0.11
  nm in the 5 and 10 wt\% water systems respectively. The approximate size of the pore
  region increases with water content (see Section~\ref{section:membrane_components}), 
  however we did not quantify the pore radius because its definition is ambiguous. As
  described in our previous work, there is not a hard partition between the pore and tail
  regions.~\cite{coscia_understanding_2019} Rather, there is a gradual transition from 
  the hydrophilic to hydrophobic region. 
  %We observe the same architecture in the systems
  %studied in this paper (see Section~\ref{section:membrane_components}).

  To study a given solute, we added 6 solute molecules, equally spaced in $z$, to the
  center of each pore of the equilibrated cross-linked configuration, for a total of 24
  solute molecules. We chose 6 solutes per pore to provide a balance of a useful amount of 
  data for generating statistics and a low degree of interaction between solutes (see 
  Section~\ref{S-section:solute_interaction} of Appendix B). At each
  insertion point we placed a randomly oriented solute molecule then ran a short 
  energy minimization. We allowed the solutes to equilibrate at 300K for 5 ns using Berendsen
  pressure control then collected transport data over the course of 1 $\mu$s MD simulations
  with pressure controlled by the Parrinello-Rahman barostat.

  \subsection{Mean Squared Displacement}\label{method:MSD}

  We measured the time-averaged $z$-direction (parallel to the pores) mean squared
  displacement (MSD) of the centers of mass (COM) of each solute over the course of 
  1 $\mu$s MD simulations using 
  Equation~\ref{eqn:ta_msd}:
  \begin{equation}
	\overline{z^2(\tau)} = \dfrac{1}{T - \tau}\int_{0}^{T - \tau} (z(t + \tau) - z(t))^2 dt
	\label{eqn:ta_msd}
  \end{equation}
  where $\tau$ is the time lag and T is the length of the trajectory~\cite{meroz_toolbox_2015}. 
  The MSD, in standard treatments, grows according to Equation~\ref{eqn:msd_form1}:
  \begin{equation} 
	\langle z^2(t) \rangle = K_{\alpha}t^\alpha
	\label{eqn:msd_form1}
  \end{equation} 
  where $\alpha$ is the anomalous exponent and $K_\alpha$ is the generalized diffusion 
  coefficient. A value of $\alpha < 1$ indicates a subdiffusive process, while a value 
  of $\alpha = 1$ and $\alpha > 1$ is characteristic of Brownian and superdiffusive
  motion respectively.

  In practice, $\alpha$ corresponds to the growth of the \textit{ensemble} MSD given
  by Equation~\ref{eqn:ensemble_msd}~\cite{meroz_toolbox_2015}:
  \begin{equation}
	\langle z^2(t) \rangle = \langle z(t) - z(0) \rangle
	\label{eqn:ensemble_msd}
  \end{equation}
  Since the ensemble MSD is calculated with respect to a reference position, it carries
  some dependence on its starting point. The time-averaged MSD averages over all possible
  time lags of a given length, effectively eliminating any initial configuration 
  dependence and generating	an increased number of observations. For ergodic systems, 
  both types of MSDs will be equal. Since we have a small number of solutes with which to
  generate statistics and because we are not calculating values of $\alpha$ for this 
  particular study,	we will only use the time-averaged MSD.
  
  We fixed the length of each simulated trajectory so that we could compare the total
  MSD between different solutes without the influence of the aging phenomenon.
  In systems such as ours where solutes show hopping behavior between long periods 
  of immobility, aging is defined by the tendency of the average slope of an MSD 
  curve to decrease as the length of trajectories are increased~\cite{metzler_anomalous_2014}.
  Since the maximum measured dwell time can be no longer than the total length of a simulated
  trajectory, longer dwell times are incorporated into the calculation as measurement
  time or trajectory length is increased, lowering the average MSD. Because the solute 
  MSDs are non-linear and because of the aging phenomenon, we did not attempt to calculate
  a diffusion constant as one might for a Brownian particle with a linear MSD. Instead,
  the reported MSD values represent the average MSD for a given	solute after a 400
  ns time lag. Our results are shown to be insensitive to our choice of time lag in 
  Section~\ref{S-section:lag_sensitivity} of Appendix B.
  
  The $z$-direction MSD of water in the 10 wt\% system \textit{is} linear to within 
  statistical precision. Therefore, for the purpose of comparison, we calculated its
  diffusion constant by fitting a line to the linear region of the MSD curve.~\cite{maginn_best_2018}. The diffusion constant
  is then equal to $m/2$ where $m$ is the slope of the linear fit. The slope is divided
  by 2 (rather than 6) because we only measured particle displacement in one dimension.

  \subsection{Molecular Size Determination}\label{method:molecular_size}
  
  In order to determine an effective radius for each solute, we divided in 
  half the maximum pairwise distance between atoms of each solute over the course of
  a 2.5 ns simulation of solutes dissolved in a cubic box of water. Each box 
  consisted of about 2100 water molecules and 6 solutes. Although there exist
  more involved methods for determining the hydrodynamic radius~\cite{schultz_determination_1961},
  we chose to use a simpler and more intuitive metric since we are only interested
  in observing trends in the solute MSD as a function
  of solute size.
  
  \subsection{The Stokes-Einstein Relationship}\label{method:stokes}
  
  The Stokes-Einstein relationship expresses the diffusion coefficient of 
  a hard spherical particle as a function that is inversely related to the
  particle's radius:
  \begin{equation}
  D = \dfrac{k_bT}{6\pi\eta fr}
  \label{eqn:stokes-einstein}
  \end{equation}
  where $k_b$ and $T$ are the Boltzmann	constant and the system temperature
  respectively and $\eta$ is the system's viscosity. Here we have also 
  included the microfriction correction factor, $f$, introduced by 
  Gierer and Wirtz~\cite{gierer_molekulare_1953,chen_diffusion_1984} for when
  solute size becomes on the order of solvent size since the solute can no 
  longer be treated as a non-interacting hard sphere. $f$ is defined in terms
  of the ratio of $r_1$ and $r_2$, the radii of the solute and solvent molecules
  respectively:
  \begin{equation}
  f = \left(1.5\dfrac{r_2}{r_1} + \dfrac{1}{1 + \dfrac{r_2}{r_1}}\right)^{-1}
  %f = \left(1.5(r_2/r_1) + \dfrac{1}{1 + (r_2/r_1)}\right)^{-1}
  \label{eqn:correction_factor}
  \end{equation}
  For consistency with the presentation of our results, rather than calculate 
  trends in $D$, we will calculate trends in solute MSDs. For Brownian
  particles, $D$ is proportional to the MSD divided by time, $t$. Therefore, 
  we analyze qualitative trends in solute MSDs according to:
  \begin{equation}
  MSD = \dfrac{k_bTt}{6\pi\eta fr}
  \label{eqn:msd-stokes-einstein}
  \end{equation}
  We hold $t$ constant in our simulations in order to make side-by-side comparisons. 
  
  Since we will be using Equation~\ref{eqn:msd-stokes-einstein} for primarily qualitative observations, 
  we made a number of simplifying assumptions so that it could easily be used for 
  comparison between systems. First, we assume that all systems' viscosities
  are equal since we only make minor changes to the membrane's composition and
  accurately assessing the viscosity in a complex and inhomogeneous system such 
  as ours is a challenge by itself. Second, we assume all particles are approximately
  spherical, neglecting the effect of solute shape on mobility. Chan et al. 
  showed that the difference in diffusion constants of differently shaped 
  particles, with constant molecular volume, did not differ by more than 25\%
  with most deviating by less than 10\%.~\cite{chan_effects_2015}. 
  Third, we assume that the ratio of solute and solvent radii as calculated using the
  methodology of Section~\ref{method:molecular_size}, is equivalent to the the 
  ratio of hydrodynamic radii. For similarly shaped molecules, it has been shown that
  one can relate the hydrodynamic radius and radius of gyration (R\textsubscript{g})
  using a constant scaling factor. \cite{lee_molecular_2008,he_novel_2003,li_critical_2009}.
  Assuming that our end-to-end distance reasonably approximates R\textsubscript{g} 
  for our small, relatively inflexible molecules, we believe this assumption is 
  justified for qualitative demonstrations relevant to this study. 
  
  We fit Equation~\ref{eqn:msd-stokes-einstein} so that it passed through the
  highest solute MSD. We assumed that the solute with the highest MSD exhibited
  the closest to Brownian behavior and therefore could set a rough boundary
  between subdiffusive, Brownian and superdiffusive MSDs. As a lower bound to our
  approximation, we also plotted the uncorrected version of
  Equation~\ref{eqn:stokes-einstein} ($f$=1), requiring it to converge to the
  same value as the corrected curve for large radii. 

  \subsection{Hop Detection}\label{method:hop_detection}
  
  In order to measure the length of hops, we first needed to detect
  when they occurred. We used an off-line change point detection 
  algorithm, implemented in the python package \texttt{ruptures}
  \cite{truong_ruptures:_2018}, in order to determine at which 
  points hops occurred in the time series of each solutes' COM. We
  used the 3 dimensional COM positions of each solute, rather than
  just the $z$-direction, in order to detect lateral hops. However,
  hop lengths are reported as their displacement in the $z$-direction.
  We reported the standard error in the average hop lengths by 
  bootstrapping the empirical distribution of observed
  hop lengths.\cite{efron_introduction_1994}

  We determined the average frequency of hops by dividing the total number of 
  hops by the total length of the simulation. We used the frequency of
  hops per 1000 ns as the $\lambda$ parameter in a Poisson distribution.
  We calculated the 1$\sigma$ confidence intervals of the probability % BJC: not sure best way to write 1-sigma CI
  distribution of hops per 1000 ns based on the corresponding Poisson 
  cumulative distribution function and scaled them to a per--nanosecond basis. 
  
  We differentiated between the length of hops inside and outside of the 
  pores. For 10 wt\% water systems, we consider a solute to be in the pore
  if it is within 0.75 nm of a pore center. This radial cut-off maximizes 
  the difference between average hop lengths in and out of the pore. 
  See Section~\ref{S-section:pore-region} of Appendix B for further details on this optimization.
  
  \subsection{Time Spent in Pore Region}
  
  Using the cut-off defined above, we calculated the fraction of time
  that a solute spends within the pore region. Since this is a process
  with two possible outcomes, we calculated the standard error ($SE$) of our
  calculations based on the binomial theorem: 
  \begin{equation}
  SE = \sqrt{\dfrac{p(1-p)}{n}}
  \end{equation}
  where $p$ is the probability that a solute is in the pore region and
  $n$ is the sample size. Here $n$ is the total number of transitions
  between each region. 
  
  \subsection{Identification and Analysis of Hydrogen Bonds}\label{method:hbonds}  % Could just make title 'Hydrogen Bonds'

  Based on the geometric criteria proposed by Luzar and Chandler 
  \cite{luzar_effect_1996}, we determined a hydrogen bond to exist if the
  distance between the donor, D, and acceptor, A, atoms is less than 
  3.5 \AA~and the angle formed by D--H$\cdot\cdot\cdot$A is less than 30\degree. Attempts
  to describe a hydrogen bond in the context of molecular simulations has
  yielded a number of definitions with no true consensus 
  \cite{prada-gracia_quest_2013} especially since the geometry of hydrogen
  bonds has some dependence on the system being studied. The definition of
  Luzar and Chandler is easily visualized for trajectories using the 
  \texttt{hbonds} representation of the Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) software 
  package which allows us to directly check the validity of identified hydrogen 
  bonds~\cite{humphrey_VMD:_1996}. In Section~\ref{S-section:hbond_sensitivity} 
  of Appendix B, we show that our conclusions are insensitive
  to this definition within a reasonable range of distances and angles. 
  
  We determined the average percentage of solutes
  which actively participated in a hydrogen bond interaction with monomers 
  each frame. Unless noted otherwise, we only counted unique solute--monomer
  hydrogen bond interactions, meaning solutes that hydrogen bond more than 
  once simultaneously were classified as a single pairing event. We determined
  the standard error of this calculation by bootstrapping over each solute's 
  trajectory. For each bootstrap trial, we randomly chose 24 solutes with 
  replacement and calculated the average active solute--monomer hydrogen bonds per frame.

  \subsection{Coordination Number}\label{method:coordination}

  We quantified the coordination of solute constituent atoms with sodium ions.
  For each frame, we counted the number of coordinated molecules to a
  given solute atom based on a distance cut-off. Using four different methods,
  Rowley and Roux observed peaks in the radial distribution function for sodium
  coordinated with water at an O--Na distance of between 2.3 and 2.5 \AA.
  \cite{rowley_solvation_2012} We used 2.5 \AA~as the distance cut-off in our
  calculations. We found that this approach is more useful than calculating 
  the 3D spherical radial distribution function because it gives detailed 
  frame-by-frame information rather than an average. 
  
  Using our procedure, we found that sodium ions in a solution of TIP3P water
  coordinate with an average of 3.6 water molecules. We created a 4 x 4 x 4
  nm cubic box of water with the GROMACS tool, \texttt{gmx solvate}. We used
  \texttt{gmx genion} to replace water molecules with sodium and chloride 
  ions in order to create a 0.1 M NaCl solution. We let the system simulate
  for 5 ns and reported the average number of coordinated water molecules 
  per frame after discarding the first nanosecond of simulation.
  
  We determined the average percentage of solutes actively coordinated to
  a sodium ion each frame. Our calculation procedure is analogous to that for
  solute--monomer hydrogen bond interactions outlined in the previous section.
  
  \subsection{Association Lifetimes}\label{method:lifetimes}
  
  We quantified the length that two species stay associated via hydrogen
  bonding or coordination. For each unique pair, we measured the number of 
  consecutive frames in which they stayed associated. We considered pairs
  that disassociated for a single time step and reformed on the next time
  step as a single continuous association event. We compiled the length 
  of these events into a distribution of association lifetimes.
  
  Hydrogen bond lifetimes appear to be distributed according to a power law or an
  exponential function (see Figure~\ref{S-fig:lifetime_distributions} of
  Appendix B). A number of researchers provide evidence that supports a 
  power law distribution~\cite{starr_fast_1999,martiniano_insights_2013}. However, these
  studies were done on extremely short timescales relative to ours, outputting positions
  every time step. Voloshin et al. studied hydrogen bonding on multiple timescales and 
  observed exponential behavior on the longest timescales~\cite{voloshin_hydrogen_2009}. 
  Due to memory limitations, we could not collect data frequently enough to provide a
  sufficient answer to this question so when comparing solutes, we use the 95\textsuperscript{th} 
  percentile of hydrogen bond dwell times. This places emphasis on solutes with 
  long dwell times. We reported the standard error of this calculation by bootstrapping
  the distribution of dwell times.
  
  The distribution of sodium association lifetimes appear similar to
  hydrogen bond life time distributions. Therefore, we reported association
  lifetimes in the same manner as hydrogen bond lifetimes.
  
  \subsection{Radial Distribution Functions}\label{method:rdfs}

  We measured the average radial distance of each solute of interest 
  from the pore centers. We binned the radial distances and then 
  normalized by the volume of the annulus defined by the bin edges.
  We generated 1$\sigma$ confidence intervals by bootstrapping the 
  RDFs of each individual solute 200 times. For each solute, we obtained
  an RDF averaged over the entire simulation trajectory. We randomly 
  chose individual solute RDFs with replacement from the set of 24 and averaged 
  each set for each bootstrap trial in order to generate a distribution from 
  which to calculate uncertainties. 
  This approach assumes that solute positions are uncorrelated to
  other solutes which we believe is valid due to the low degree of 
  interaction between solutes described in Section~\ref{method:system_setup}.
  
  Although the pores are often described as straight, they have a
  small degree of tortuosity which disrupts the RDF calculation. We 
  tried to mitigate the effects of tortuosity by calculating the RDF
  with respect to splines that run through the pore centers. See
  Section~\ref{S-section:splines} of Appendix B for 
  a graphical illustration. Each spline consists of 10 points, equally
  spaced in the $z$-direction, whose ($x$, $y$) coordinates are defined
  based on the COM of all head groups closest, in $z$, to the
  given point. When calculating RDFs, the radial distance from the pore 
  center is based on the distance between the solute COM and
  the linearly interpolated ($x$, $y$) coordinates of the pore center 
  calculated based on the closest two spline points. Using the splines, 
  we calculated the tortuosity of the pores by calculating the ratio 
  $\dfrac{L}{Z}$ where $L$ is the length of the spline and $Z$ is the 
  length of the unit cell in the $z$-direction. The average tortuosity
  of each pore is 1.03 $\pm$ 0.01 and 1.07 $\pm$ 0.02 in the 5 and 10 wt\%
  water systems respectively.
  
  In all RDF plots, we include the average RDF of the head groups as a 
  reference. The head group RDF shown is the average of the head group
  RDFs for each solute system in the plot. We generated 1$\sigma$ 
  confidence intervals by bootstrapping the RDFs in the same way we did
  the solutes. We scaled the head group RDF so that it would be in frame
  next to solute RDFs.
   
  \section{Results and Discussion}
  
  \subsection{Structure of Membrane Constituents}\label{section:membrane_components} 
  
  Before beginning our analysis of solute transport behavior, it is important to
  elucidate the topology of the membrane pores in solvated systems.  
  
  In contrast to our previous work with a dry version of this membrane, the 
  region close to the pore center of the 5 and 10 wt\% water systems is 
  primarily filled with water and sodium ions. Figure~\ref{fig:component_densities}
  plots the RDF of each membrane constituent in the dry system as well as the
  5 and 10 wt\% water systems. In dry systems, the pore center is densely 
  filled with sodium ions and head groups. In hydrated systems, water occupies, 
  and is densest, at the center of each pore. The density of sodium ions is 
  somewhat uniform in the pore center of the 5 wt\% water system while it shows
  a maximum closer to the head groups in the 10 wt\% water system. The peak 
  density of sodium ions is not at the pore center in the 10 wt\% water system
  likely because they are associated with the monomer's carboxylate head groups.
  
  Pores in the 10 wt\% water system are wider and less crowded by monomers than
  those in the 5 wt\% water system. The peak head group density of 10 wt\% water
  systems is about 0.2 nm further from the pore center than the 5 wt\% water system. 
  Based on these observations, we expect solute transport to be fastest in the 
  10 wt\% water system.

  \end{figure}

  There is an appreciable amount of water that partitions into the distal tail
  region of both systems. 28\% and 31\% of the total water is present in the
  distal tail regions of the 5 and 10 wt\% water systems respectively. See 
  Section~\ref{S-section:water_content_equil} of Appendix B 
  for more details on the equilibrations that led to this conclusion. The partition
  is due to a combination of the distal tail region's lower density (see 
  Figure~\ref{fig:total_density}) as well as oxygen atoms at the ends of each
  monomer tail which can further stabilize water molecules.

  \end{figure}
  
  We will restrict our studies of transport to solutes and water outside of the 
  distal tail region because transport is fastest in the pores. We provide more 
  rigorous justification for this restriction at the end of Section~\ref{section:transport_water_sodium}.

  \subsection{Mechanisms Governing Small Solute Transport}\label{section:mechanism_overview} 

  We observed transport of sodium, water and 20 other small polar solutes
  inside the membrane nanopores. First, we comment on transport of the
  membrane constituents, water and sodium, in a system absent of any additional
  solutes. We then present the general trends that we observe among 
  all other solutes studied.
  
  \subsubsection{Water and Sodium Ions}\label{section:transport_water_sodium} 

  Water and sodium's mobilities increase in larger and less crowded pores. 
  In the 10 wt\% water system, the MSD of water is about 51 times higher and
  the MSD of sodium is about 49 times higher compared to the 5 wt\% water system. 
  In the 10 wt\% water system, water moves about 51 times faster than sodium 
  and in the 5 wt\% system, water moves about 49 times faster than sodium. Due to
  the linearity of water's MSD in the 10 wt\% water system, we assumed
  long timescale Brownian behavior and measured its diffusivity to be 
  $7.45 \times 10^{-7}$cm$^2$/s which is only 1.4\% that of bulk TIP3P 
  water.~\cite{mahoney_diffusion_2000} %BJC: 7.45e-07 versus 5.19e-05 cm^2/s
  
  \begin{figure}[!htb]

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption{(a) The $z$-direction MSD of water in the 10 wt\% water system 
  is about 51 times higher than water in the 5 wt\% water system. Water 
  appears to exhibit Brownian motion in the 10 wt\% system due to its
  linear MSD. (b) The MSD of sodium in the 10 wt\% water system is about 
  49 times higher than sodium in the 5 wt\% water system.}\label{fig:msd_comparison}
  \end{figure}

  Sodium coordinates with both water and carboxylate moieties from the head
  groups in the pores. Sodium coordinates with 3.4 water molecules in bulk 
  solution (see Section~\ref{method:coordination}), but on average in the pores,
  coordinates with 1.7 water molecules in the 10 wt\% system and 1.2 water
  molecules in the 5 wt\% system. The sodium ions additionally coordinate with
  1 carboxylate group in the 10 wt\% water system and 0.8 carboxylate groups 
  in the 5 wt\% water system. This behavior likely slows the motion of the 
  sodium ions considerably compared to in bulk water.

  In the 10 wt\% water system, water molecules that spend the majority of 
  their time in the distal tail region move significantly slower than those
  close to the pore center. In Figure~\ref{fig:water_msd_comparison}, we 
  constructed the MSD curves based on water molecules that spent $>$ 95\% of their
  time outside the distal tail region. If we instead restrict our calculation to
  water molecules that spend $>$ 95\% of their time \textit{in} the distal tail region, 
  the MSD of water is about 8 times lower, decreasing from 59.6 to 8.2 nm$^2$. 

  In the 5 wt\% water system, water molecules that spend the majority of their 
  time in the distal tail region have MSDs slightly higher than those of water molecules
  close to the pore center. The MSD of distal tail water molecules is 1.7 nm$^2$
  compared to 1.2 nm$^2$ outside the distal tails. This behavior is likely due to the
  much more crowded pore environment in the 5 wt\% versus the 10 wt\% water system. 
  Monomer head groups are concentrated about 2~\AA~closer to the pore centers in the
  5 wt\% versus the 10 wt\% water system (see Figure~\ref{fig:component_densities})
  which leaves less space for water molecules and restricts their movement among the 
  relatively immobile monomer head groups. The consequently high energetic barrier 
  to diffusion enhances the favorability of associative interactions between water
  and monomer components. The 95th percentile lifetime of hydrogen bonds between 
  water molecules located near the pore center is 2.1 ns in the 5 wt\% system compared
  to 0.5 ns in the 10 wt\% system. However, since we only saved simulation output 
  every 0.5 ns, it is likely that the true hydrogen bond lifetimes in the 10 wt\% 
  system are shorter than this value. Additionally, there are more frequent and longer
  periods of association between water and sodium ions. An average of 65\% of water 
  molecules in the pores of the 5 wt\% water system associate with a sodium ion each
  frame compared to 44\% in the 10 wt\% water system.There are about half as many water
  molecules in the 5 wt\% water system which allows a larger fraction of them to 
  associate with sodium ions. The lifetime of associations between sodium ions and 
  water is 7.5 ns and 3.0 ns in 5 and 10 wt\% water systems respectively.
  
  Because the MSD of water in the pores of the 10 wt\% system is significantly
  higher than that in the tails, we restrict our studies of transport in this
  paper to solutes in or near the pore center. Transport of solutes in the pores
  is likely to be the limiting factor that determines permeability and rejection.
  Although tail transport of water in the the 5 wt\% water system is faster than
  pore transport, water transport overall is significantly slower than in the 10
  wt\% system. For practical applications, a membrane with water transport
  properties comparable to the 10 wt\% system is far more feasible than the 5
  wt\% system.

 \subsubsection{Transport of Small Polar Solutes}\label{section:general_transport_solutes}  
  
  We observe trends in transport properties that are dependent on the chemical 
  environment within the nanopores rather than just solute size. Polar solutes
  are slowed by interactions between monomer functional groups and ions. 
  A thorough understanding of these interactions will help us to create monomer
  design principles. We will begin our analysis by considering the collective
  trends observed across all systems and then focus on subsets of molecules
  with structural similarities.

  As with water and sodium, the MSDs of the solutes studied in this work are 
  significantly larger in the 10 wt\% system than those in the 5 wt\% water 
  system (see Figures~\ref{fig:all_msds_5wt} and~\ref{fig:all_msds_10wt}). The fastest moving solute in both cases, 
  methanol, has an MSD about 26 times larger in the 10 versus the 5 wt\%
  water system. Clearly the equilibrium water content of a given LLC system will 
  determine its viability for real separations.
  
  The MSDs are not solely a function of solute size. We plotted each solute's radius
  against their MSD in Figures~\ref{fig:msd_radius_5wt} and~\ref{fig:msd_radius_10wt}.
  Of all the solutes, methanol is likely subject to the least hindrance by
  the membrane due its small size. Therefore we fit Equation~\ref{eqn:msd-stokes-einstein}
  so that it intersects with methanol's average MSD and radius. The uncorrected version of 
  Equation~\ref{eqn:msd-stokes-einstein} ($f$=1) is plotted and converges to the same value as the
  corrected form for large radii (see Section~\ref{method:stokes}). Although both curves are 
  approximations, they illustrate that the majority of solutes in our study show
  lower than expected MSDs. In most cases, the predicted MSDs even fall below the 
  conservative uncorrected Stokes-Einstein estimate. It is clear that more complex
  mechanisms determine the MSDs of these solutes.

  \end{figure}
    
  On the timescales simulated in our study, solutes exhibit subdiffusive
  behavior. Figure~\ref{fig:example_ztraces} plots the $z$-coordinate versus
  time of 3 representative ethanol centers of mass in the 10 wt\% water system.
  There are clear periods of entrapment separated by relatively large hops.
  The MSD calculated based on all ethanol molecules is plotted in 
  Figure~\ref{fig:example_msd} and its shape is sublinear. The long periods
  of entrapment lead in part to this sublinear, and thus subdiffusive, behavior.

  \end{figure}
  
  The complex and inhomogeneous structure of the membrane leads to radially
  dependent transport mechanisms. In general, we observed that hops 
  made in the pore region are about 59\% larger than those made outside
  the pore region (see Figure~\ref{fig:hop_lengths}). There is a high 
  resistance to movement in the alkane-dense head group and tail regions
  while, in the pore region, solutes can move relatively freely since it 
  is primarily composed of water molecules. However, time spent in the 
  pore region does not necessarily lead to more frequent hopping. The 
  largest solutes in this study spend the most time in the pore region
  (see Figure~\ref{fig:frac_time}), but many hop with a below-average
  frequency (see Figure~\ref{fig:hopfreq}). Therefore, trapping mechanisms
  controlled by membrane properties other than alkane density must be prevalent.

  The trend in hop lengths is similar to the trend in MSDs shown in 
  Figure~\ref{fig:all_msds_10wt} implying that solutes which make consistently 
  larger hops have higher MSDs. The fraction of time spent by a solute in the 
  pore region (b) does not necessarily lead to more frequent hopping (c). For
  example, ribose spends the largest fraction of time in the pore region, yet
  hops the fifth least frequently.}\label{fig:hops}
  \end{figure}
  
  We observe a second trapping mechanism caused by preferential hydrogen 
  bonding between hydrogen bond donor solutes and monomer head groups. To 
  continue with our ethanol example, we observe that 64\% of ethanol
  molecules donate hydrogen bonds
  and 3\% of ethanol molecules accept hydrogen bonds each frame. On average, 40\%
  of hydrogen bonds donated by ethanol go to carboxylate 
  head groups, 25\% go to the ether linkages connecting the monomer tails to the 
  head groups and the remaining 35\% to water. There are about 46\% less 
  carboxylate oxygen atoms in the pore than there are water molecules yet more
  hydrogen bonds are donated to them. The stability of hydrogen bonds with 
  carboxylate oxygen atoms is high because they have a negative charge
  with no neutralizing positive charges nearby. Additionally, on average, 
  each sodium ion is coordinated to 1.7 water molecules meaning an appreciable
  fraction of the water molecules occupying the pore region are usually 
  coordinated to a sodium ion which decreases their availability to accept 
  hydrogen bonds from solutes.
  
  The lifetime of hydrogen bonds between solutes and monomer head groups tends to 
  be longer for solutes that hydrogen bond more frequently. In Figure~\ref{fig:hbonds}
  we see nearly the same ordering of the percentage of solutes hydrogen bonded to
  monomer head groups and the 95\textsuperscript{th} percentile of hydrogen bond 
  lifetimes. Solutes with multiple hydroxyl groups donate hydrogen bonds most 
  frequently and tend to stay hydrogen bonded longer. Hydrogen bonds donated by
  nitrogen are far less common and tend to be short-lived as shown by acetamide
  and urea.

  hydrogen bonds. Individual solutes that hydrogen bond with multiple head groups
  simultaneously are only counted once. (b) The lifetime of individual hydrogen
  bonds appears correlated to the percentage of solutes involved in hydrogen bond
  interactions. Hydrogen bond lifetimes tend to be longer for solutes that 
  hydrogen bond frequently. Note that solutes incapable of donating hydrogen
  bonds are omitted from this figure.}\label{fig:hbonds}
  \end{figure}
  
  Finally, we observe slowing or immobilization of solutes that associate with
  sodium counterions. Much like water, the polarity of the solutes creates 
  regions of high electron density, modeled using partial negative charges, 
  which are stabilized through electrostatic interactions with sodium ions. 
  In Figure~\ref{fig:na_coordination}, we've plotted the average percentage
  of solutes coordinated to a sodium ion each frame as well as the
  95\textsuperscript{th} percentile of sodium association lifetimes. The degree and length of 
  coordination between solutes and sodium in the 5 wt\% water system is higher
  in all cases than that in the 10 wt\% water systems. The crowded pores of 
  the 5 wt\% water system force sodium ions in close proximity to solutes. 
  
  Carbonyl functional groups tend to associate with sodium the most. Nearly
  all of the most coordinated solutes contain a carbonyl group (except for 
  DMSO which has an analogous sulfinyl group). There is a significant
  drop in sodium ion association for solutes that do not contain carbonyl 
  groups or multiple hydroxyl groups to compensate. The corresponding association
  lifetimes follow a similar trend, however the association lifetimes of highly coordinated 
  solutes with multiple hydroxyl groups are generally lower since association
  between hydroxyl groups and sodium is apparently a weaker interaction. Carbonyl
  groups contain an exposed and highly electron-dense oxygen atom which interacts
  readily with sodium ions. Carbonyl groups with nitrogen substituents appear
  to interact with sodium more frequently than those with carbon substituents. 
  Acetone associates with sodium significantly less than urea and acetamide.

  Coordination of ions with oxygen has been observed in a variety of systems. 
  Carvajal et al. noted that Na\textsuperscript{+} coordinated with four 
  THF molecules when they dissolved a sodium salt in the solvent.~\cite{carvajal_studies_1965}
  Wu et al. observed coordination of Na\textsuperscript{+} with the carbonyl
  group of a molecule used to design an organic electrode.~\cite{wu_unraveling_2015} 
  Finally, Shinoda et al. observed K\textsuperscript{+} ions coordinated with
  the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups of carboxy-terminal groups in crystallized
  ATPase.~\cite{shinoda_crystal_2009}
  
  Overall, the transport behavior exhibited by solutes in the 5 wt\% water
  systems is similar to that shown by those in the 10 wt\% system; however
  the timescales are much longer. We observe subdiffusive behavior with 
  intermittent hopping between periods of entrapment and evidence
  of the same three trapping mechanisms. The frequency and 
  length of hops are both diminished in the 5 wt\% system. Since there are
  only 24 solute molecules in each system, in order to obtain better 
  time-averaged descriptions of solute transport mechanisms, we will focus
  the remainder of our analysis on transport in the 10 wt\% water systems.
  
  We will revisit our observations in the the context of specific groups of 
  molecules in the discussion that follows.
  
  \subsection{Transport of Simple Alcohols}

  The MSDs of methanol, ethanol, propanol and butanol descend in order of 
  their size. Using methanol as a reference, the larger alcohols move slower
  than expected according to both the pure Stokes-Einstein relationship 
  and the corrected relationship (see Figure~\ref{fig:msd_radius_simple_alcohol_rdf}).
  
  Methanol has the highest MSD of all solutes because it makes the most frequent
  and longest hops (see Figure~\ref{fig:hops}). Somewhat counterintuitively, 
  methanol, along with the other simple alcohols, spends a smaller fraction of its
  time in the pore region than most other solutes. However, even outside the pore
  region, hops made by methanol are larger than those made by almost any other solute
  in the pore region. The small size of methanol allows it to move relatively unhindered. 

  The RDFs of longer chain alcohols show a sharp peak near the head groups 
  (see Figure~\ref{fig:simple_alcohol_rdf}). On average, the density of methanol
  in the pore center is only slightly less than its density near the head 
  groups while all other alcohol molecules are most concentrated near the head
  groups.
  
  All simple alcohols participate in a similar number of hydrogen bonding 
  interactions with the monomer head groups, but with varying preference towards
  hydrogen bonds with the monomer carboxylate oxygen atoms over the ether oxygen
  atoms that connect the tails to the head groups (see Figure~\ref{fig:simple_alcohol_hbonds}).
  If all 5 hydrogen bonding acceptor sites on the monomer head groups were equal,
  we would expect the ratio of the number of hydrogen bonds between solutes and
  the two carboxylate oxygen atoms to the number of hydrogen bonds between solutes
  and the three ether groups to be 2/3. There is a clear preference towards 
  hydrogen bonding with the carboxylate oxygen atoms for all simple alcohols. 
  This is largely due to the high net charge of the carboxylate groups as well
  as the more highly crowded environment surrounding the ether oxygen atoms. 
  Butanol shows the largest preference towards hydrogen bonds with carboxylate
  head groups. The radial distribution function of atoms located at opposite ends
  of butanol (Figure~\ref{fig:butanol_CO}) shows that, on average, oxygen atoms are situated closer to the pore
  centers than the most distal carbon atoms. This suggests that long chain alcohols
  will tend to orient themselves like the liquid crystal monomers, with hydrophilic components
  directed towards the pore centers.

  highest density of monomer head groups (normalized based on propanol's maximum

  explain its fast dynamics. (c) Despite relatively little difference in the

  \end{figure}

  \subsection{Transport of Diols, Triols and Sugars}\label{section:polyols}
  
  The order of the MSDs of the diols, triols and sugars are roughly consistent with 
  their size; however, propylene glycol moves exceptionally slow (see 
  Figure~\ref{fig:polyols_msd}). Ethylene glycol has the highest MSD followed
  by tetrose and glycerol, whose MSDs are similar, propylene glycol, the second
  smallest solute of this set, and finally ribose.
  
  Transport is both facilitated and hindered by additional solute hydroxyl groups
  due to their influence on radial density and hydrogen bond frequency. Extra 
  hydroxyl groups cause solutes to favor the water-rich pore region where there 
  is the least hindrance to movement (see Figure~\ref{fig:polyols_rdf}). Tetrose,
  ribose and glycerol are densest close to the pore center. They spend a greater
  fraction of their time in the pore region than any other solute (see 
  Figure~\ref{fig:frac_time}). This is likely a consequence of both their 
  hydrophilicity and large size which prevents them from partitioning into the 
  head group region. However, these extra hydroxyl groups facilitate a larger 
  number of hydrogen bond interactions that work to hold solutes in place (see 
  Figure~\ref{fig:multi_hbonds}). It has been observed that hydrogen bonding 
  in a system will generally reduce diffusivity.~\cite{srinivas_computer_1999}
  
  The number of hydrogen bonding interactions between solutes and head groups
  increases with the number of solute hydroxyl groups. These solutes frequently
  undergo simultaneous hydrogen bond interactions as shown in 
  Figure~\ref{fig:multi_hbonds}. For example, both hydroxyl groups of ethylene
  glycol can undergo hydrogen bonds with different hydrogen bond acceptors at 
  the same time. In some cases, all 4 hydroxyl groups of ribose hydrogen bond
  to monomer head groups simultaneously. As a consequence, hydrogen bond 
  lifetimes in these cases tend to be longer (see Figure~\ref{fig:hbond_dwells})
  since the solute positions are stabilized by multiple interactions. When one
  hydrogen bond is broken, the remaining unbroken hydrogen bonds keep the 
  molecule in place and allow the previously broken bond to reform.
  Proximity to the pore center partially compensates for this effect in
  the cases of glycerol and tetrose, causing them to have relatively high MSDs
  for their size.

  theoretical lines were fit. (b) Glycerol, tetrose and ribose have high densities 
  close to the pore center because they have a high number of hydrophilic groups and

  monomers increases as solutes gain additional hydroxyl groups. The number of 
  hydrogen bonds made by a single solute in different locations simultaneously, n, 
  also increases with the number of hydroxyl groups. In the most extreme case, all 
  four hydroxyl groups of ribose (n = 4) are involved in a hydrogen bond interaction
  at the same time.}\label{fig:polyols}
  \end{figure}
  
  Of the two diols, ethylene glycol moves significantly faster than propylene
  glycol due to propylene glycol's affinity for the monomer head groups.
  Combined with an increase in size, the addition of a single methyl group to
  ethylene glycol increases propylene glycol's hydrophobic character and causes
  it to favor positions near monomer head groups (see Figure~\ref{fig:polyols_rdf}).
  Both diols have comparable densities close to the pore center, however propylene
  glycol's density has a large peak near the monomer head groups relative to 
  ethylene glycol. Propylene glycol can form more highly stabilized hydrogen 
  bonds with carboxylate groups, explaining the slightly higher incidence of 
  hydrogen bonds shown in Figure~\ref{fig:multi_hbonds}. The 95\textsuperscript{th}
  percentile of hydrogen bond lifetimes for propylene glycol with monomers is 
  9.5 ns compared to 7 ns for ethylene glycol. Somewhat counterintuitively, there is a 
  relatively high density of ethylene glycol molecules beyond the head group region
  probably due to its relatively small size. This likely contributes to the somewhat
  large error bars on its MSD in Figure~\ref{fig:msds2}. 

  \subsection{Transport of Ketones and Amides}
  
  The 4 ketone-like molecules tested show a range of transport behaviors. 
  Urea, acetic acid, acetamide and acetone are all characterized by
  a carbonyl group with two attached heavy atoms. All are similar in size and
  are planar molecules due to the $sp^2$ hybridization of their carbonyl group. 
  The fastest solutes of this grouping, acetic acid and urea, move about 3
  times faster than the slowest, acetone.
  
  The amides, urea and acetamide, hydrogen bond with head groups relatively 
  infrequently, but regularly coordinate with sodium ions (see 
  Figure~\ref{fig:ketones}). In an average frame, over 50\% of acetic acid molecules
  participate in hydrogen bonds with monomer head groups while less than 
  10\% of urea and acetamide molecules hydrogen bond with head groups. 
  Urea and acetamide both have hydrogen bond donating nitrogen atoms, however
  nitrogen is a weaker hydrogen bond donor than oxygen due to its lower 
  electronegativity.~\cite{biswal_hydrogen_2015} Given their lower propensity
  to hydrogen bond, one might expect amides to partition out of the pore 
  and/or to move through the pore quickly, perhaps faster than methanol. 
  However, both RDFs contain sharp peaks situated between the pore center
  and the head groups, but closer to the pore center than other solutes 
  that hydrogen bond with carboxylate groups. Solutes that
  hydrogen bond frequently tend to show peaks in their RDFs near 0.5-0.6 nm 
  from the pore center (see Figure~\ref{fig:simple_alcohol_rdf}, for example)
  and those that coordinate with sodium ions more frequently tend to show 
  peaks in their RDFs near 0.2-0.4 nm from the pore center. Both solutes spend
  about half of their time with their carbonyl oxygen atom coordinated to a
  sodium ion which restrains the solutes to within the pore region
  
  Among the solutes in this set, only the carbonyl oxygen atoms coordinate 
  with sodium ions. The nitrogen atoms do not coordinate at all despite a
  similar negative partial charge because the attached hydrogen atoms 
  shield this interaction by making the NH\textsubscript{2} group 
  approximately neutral.

  Acetone has the lowest MSD of this set because it either coordinates with
  sodium or stays trapped near and behind the head groups. Acetone spends the
  smallest fraction of time in the pore region out of all solutes in this study
  (see Figure~\ref{fig:frac_time}). On average, acetone coordinates with sodium
  with the same frequency as acetic acid which is manifested as a peak in its 
  RDF about 0.2 nm from the pore center. 
  Acetic acid and the amides have other, unoccupied, hydrophilic groups while
  bound to sodium ions which increases their stability in the pore.

  however they tend to coordinate with sodium ions more frequently. Acetone

  \end{figure}
  
  \subsection{Transport of Thiols}
  
  We also studied the transport properties of sulfur analogs of glycerol,
  ethylene glycol and acetone. We replaced all but one oxygen atom of 
  ethylene glycol and glycerol with sulfur atoms to create dimercaptoethanol
  and 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol. We replaced the carbonyl carbon of acetone
  with sulfur in order to create DMSO. Sulfur-containing compounds form weaker
  hydrogen bonds than nitrogen and oxygen-containing compounds due to their
  low electronegativity.~\cite{biswal_hydrogen_2015} For this reason, thiols
  are less soluble in water than their hydroxyl group analogs.

  unlike glycerol whose density is very high close to the pore center. 
  (c) Overall, dimethylsulfoxide has a higher density than acetone within the 
  pore region which may in part explain its marginally larger MSD.}\label{fig:sulfur_analog_rdfs}
  \end{figure}
  
  Mercaptoethanol has a similar average MSD and RDF to ethylene glycol
  (see Figures~\ref{fig:all_msds_10wt} and~\ref{fig:SOH_GCL_comparison}).
  There is a much larger uncertainty associated with mercaptoethanol's
  MSD. The range of behaviors shown by mercaptoethanol help explain the
  large variance of its MSD. Much can be accounted for by the higher 
  density of mercaptoethanol molecules outside the pore region, where 
  transport is inherently slower. Although both solutes
  hop with a similar magnitude inside and outside of the pore region, mercaptoethanol 
  spends about 18\% less time in the pore region (see Figure~\ref{fig:hops}).
  This has a large impact on its hop frequency which is 42\% lower than that 
  of ethylene glycol. This implies that mercaptoethanol is relatively
  immobile outside of the pore, but moves quickly inside.
  
  2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol exhibits slower transport than glycerol 
  because more of it partitions into the tail region (see 
  Figure~\ref{fig:DMP_GLY_comparison}). 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol
  spends 27\% less time in the pore region than glycerol. 
  Glycerol participates in about 2.5 times as many hydrogen
  bonds as 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol (including all possible hydrogen bonding groups). 
  Only 22\% of the hydrogen bond interactions of 2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol
  involve sulfur. Because sulfur can only weakly hydrogen bond, 
  2,3-dimercapto-1-propanol is less soluble than glycerol in the water-filled
  pores and more readily partitions into the tail region.
  
  DMSO has a comparable MSD to acetone even though it is a larger molecule
  (see Figure~\ref{fig:msds2}). DMSO spends 17\% more time in the pore than acetone. 
  On average, 35\% of DMSO molecules are coordinated to a sodium ion each
  frame compared with 26\% of acetone molecules. The pyramidal structure 
  of DMSO may force it to spend more time closer to the pore center which
  increases its interaction with sodium ions. The tendency of DMSO to stay
  in the pore region counterbalances the sodium ion interactions to give it
  a higher MSD than acetone. 
  
  \subsection{Solutes Unable to Donate Hydrogen Bonds}  % Need a better heading since all molecules in this study are acceptors

  The slowest set of molecules we studied can accept hydrogen bonds, but
  cannot donate them. Among this set are the two slowest solutes in our study: 
  THF and DMF. The MSDs of ethyl acetate, propylene carbonate and acetone are
  only marginally larger.
  
  The solutes in this set have small hop lengths. 3 of the bottom 6 mean hop
  lengths are associated with ethyl acetate, propylene carbonate and
  dimethyl formamide (Figure~\ref{fig:hop_lengths}). Acetone and 
  tetrahydrofuran perform slightly larger hops but with low hop frequencies
  (see Figure~\ref{fig:hopfreq}).
  
  The radial density of solutes near the pore center in this set is 
  surprisingly high as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:nondonors_rdf}. Propylene
  carbonate and ethyl acetate are among the largest solutes in this study. 
  Their size prevents them from easily entering the tail region and 
  consequently leads to faster transport properties.  % since they spend more time in the pore region. 
  However, this is not a hard rule. When a solute does overcome the 
  barrier of entry beyond the pore region, it can become trapped. All
  solutes in this set show at least a small peak in the pore region which
  is caused by solutes that get trapped in the tail region for 
  significant periods of time.
  
  Carbonyl groups continue to show high degrees of association with
  sodium ions. Between 25 and 30\% of propylene carbonate, dimethyl 
  formamide and ethyl acetate molecules are coordinated with sodium ions
  for a given frame which is consistent with the coordination exhibited by acetone
  (see Figure~\ref{fig:nondonors_hbonds}). The carbonyl group of the amides 
  studied in the previous section associate with sodium nearly twice as 
  frequently as compounds that don't contain nitrogen 
  (see Figure~\ref{fig:ketone_hbonds}).
  Association between sodium and solutes in this set are also among the longest,
  only beaten by other solutes with carbonyl groups and ribose.

  \section{Conclusion}

  We have examined the transport characteristics of a series of small polar
  molecules in our model of the H\textsubscript{II} phase formed by the liquid 
  crystal monomer Na-GA3C11. We found that transport of solutes is 
  governed by both water content as well as the interplay between the chemical functionality of the solute
  and the chemical functionality of the LLC monomer and ion making up the pore. 

  We have shown that the MSD of solutes, water and counter ions are highly
  dependent on LLC membrane water content. As more water is added to the system,
  the pores become more dilute in the monomer components. The MSDs of water and
  sodium ions are nearly 2 orders of magnitude larger in the 10 wt\% system than
  in the 5 wt\% system. The amount of water in the pores thus deserves special
  attention when screening new monomers.
  
  The transport of polar solutes in this system is significantly slower than
  that of water due to their interaction with the LLC monomers. We observed 
  three primary mechanisms of solute entrapment within the pores.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Solutes can become entangled among monomer tails. 
    \item Solutes can donate hydrogen bonds to immobile monomers.
    \item Solutes can associate with counterions.
  \end{enumerate}
  
  The chemical functionality of solutes influences the degree to which
  they are affected by each trapping mechanism. Simple alcohols tend to
  partition into the tail region as their hydrophobic tail increases in length.
  Alcohols and sugars with multiple hydroxyl groups are very stable in the pore
  region, but multiple hydrogen bonds with monomer head groups prevent them from
  diffusing quickly. This effect is reduced when hydroxyl groups are replaced
  with thiol groups, but the solutes become less stable in the pore. Finally,
  solutes with carbonyl groups, which includes the ketones, amides and solutes
  that can only accept hydrogen bonds, associate with sodium ions, temporarily
  slowing or immobilizing them. 

  Based on these trapping mechanisms, we may be able to suggest modifications
  that can be made to monomers that will modulate their effect on specific solute
  MSDs in order to make transport even more selective for particular solutes.
  Since solutes move slowly while entangled among the monomer tails, and since
  more than half of the solutes studied spend at least 40\% of their time in the
  tails, one can try to design monomers that better control the partition of
  solutes between the pore and tail region. Solutes move into the tails due both
  to their size and hydrophilic character. One may be able to contain solutes,
  even small ones like methanol, by increasing the density of monomers close to
  the head groups through incorporation of cross-linkable groups in the vicinity.
  Alternatively, removal of the ether linkages between the head groups and the
  monomer tails may decrease the stability of any of the molecules we studied
  near the head groups and force them to spend more time within the pore. 
  
  One could instead focus on designing head groups with varying hydrogen bonding
  capabilities. Increasing the number of hydrogen bonding sites on the head 
  groups may enhance the membrane's ability to trap solutes like sugars that 
  have multiple hydroxyl groups. Conversely, one can decrease the number of hydrogen
  bonding sites, or replace them with weaker hydrogen bonding atoms like nitrogen, to
  trap less. In contrast to the system studied here, one can design the head 
  groups so they can donate hydrogen bonds, which can enhance entrapment of 
  solutes like acetone that can only accept hydrogen bonds.
  
  Finally, one can attempt to control the degree to which solutes coordinate
  with counterions. Increasing the valence of the counterions may cause them
  to bind more strongly to solutes which may be a useful way to trap 
  carbonyl-containing solutes like urea for longer periods of time. Of course,
  an increased valence would require proportionately less total counterions
  to balance the system charge which could result in the opposite effect. One
  could also design the head groups so that counterions are negatively charged
  which may eliminate their interaction with most solutes.
  
  Our work demonstrates that there are important, atomistic features of nanostructured, 
  self-assembled materials that molecular simulation can play a key role in elucidating.
  The complex interplay between the inhomogeneous membrane structure, solute size and 
  solute functionality leads to a variety of solute-membrane interactions, many of which
  are quite subtle. For example, association between polar groups and ions is seldom 
  mentioned in the literature, but we could not give a complete mechanistic explanation
  of observed transport behavior without its consideration. We also observed that water
  and solutes partition into the tails, an area previously assumed to be devoid of solutes,
  which offers another route towards selectivity. The interactions we observed, along 
  with those that may arise in other self-assembled nanoporous membranes, have the 
  potential to produce an immense diversity of transport behavior, suggesting that a 
  previously unexplored range of chemical selectivities may be possible. Atomistic 
  molecular modeling is likely to be highly useful in uncovering important mechanisms
  that will inspire and accelerate novel design by experimentalists.
