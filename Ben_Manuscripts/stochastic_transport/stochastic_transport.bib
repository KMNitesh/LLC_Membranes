	abstract = {Nanostructured free-standing films were obtained by polymerisation of lyotropic liquid crystal phases based on the monomer 3,4,5-tris(11′-acryloyloxyundecyloxy)benzoate. The structure of these films was investigated by X-ray diffraction. No change of the lattice due to the polymerisation procedure was observed. The low water content (below 10 wt.-\%) of the liquid crystals in combination with the observed hexagonal lattice reveal that a reversed hexagonal structure (H2 phase) is present. Different types of films were investigated, obtained by varying the preparation conditions of the used lyotropic liquid crystals, such as water content, type of metal-counterion and length of the monomer. The lattice constant was found to be independent of the water content. It seems that at low water content of 8 wt.-\% the lyotropic structure is still fully hydrated. This unusual behaviour is related to the tapered structure of the monomer which is composed of by a small headgroup and three extended tails for each headgroup. The lattice constant can be changed by using differently charged metal-counterions which are associated with the headgroup, as well as by varying the length of the tails on the monomer. Low resolution electron density maps of the hexagonal lattice give deeper insight in the arrangement of the monomers within the polymerised structure.},

An ideal nanoporous membrane would consist of a thin film with physically continuous and vertically aligned nanopores and would display a narrow distribution of pore sizes. However, the current state of the art departs considerably from this ideal and is beset by intrinsic trade-offs between permeability and selectivity. We demonstrate an effective and scalable method to fabricate polymer films with ideal membrane morphologies consisting of submicron thickness films with physically continuous and vertically aligned 1 nm pores. The approach is based on soft confinement to control the orientation of a cross-linkable mesophase in which the pores are produced by self-assembly. The scalability, exceptional ease of fabrication, and potential to create a new class of nanofiltration membranes stand out as compelling aspects.},

Here we report facile, scalabe fabrication of polymer membranes with vertically (i.e., along the through-plane direction) aligned 1 nm pores by magnetic-field alignment and subsequent cross-linking of a liquid crystalline mesophase. We utilize a wedge-shaped amphiphilic species as the building block of a thermotropic columnar mesophase with 1 nm ionic nanochannels, and leverage the magnetic anisotropy of the amphiphile to control the alignment of these pores with a magnetic field. In situ X-ray scattering and subsequent optical microscopy reveal the formation of highly ordered nanostructured mesophases and cross-linked polymer films with orientational order parameters of ca. 0.95. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging provides direct visualization of long-range persistence of vertically aligned, hexagonally packed nanopores in unprecedented detail, demonstrating high-fidelity retention of structure and alignment after photo-cross-linking. Ionic conductivity measurements on the aligned membranes show a remarkable 85-fold enhancement of conductivity over nonaligned samples. These results provide a path to achieving the large area control of morphology and related enhancement of properties required for high-performance membranes and other applications.},

	abstract = {A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step.},

The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER, and ENCAD force fields. In addition, it can handle polarizable shell models and flexible constraints. The program is versatile, as force routines can be added by the user, tabulated functions can be specified, and analyses can be easily customized. Nonequilibrium dynamics and free energy determinations are incorporated. Interfaces with popular quantum-chemical packages (MOPAC, GAMES-UK, GAUSSIAN) are provided to perform mixed MM/QM simulations. The package includes about 100 utility and analysis programs. GROMACS is in the public domain and distributed (with source code and documentation) under the GNU General Public License.

The code encompasses a minimal-communication domain decomposition algorithm, full dynamic load balancing, a state-of-the-art parallel constraint solver, and efficient virtual site algorithms that allow removal of hydrogen atom degrees of freedom to enable integration time steps up to 5 fs for atomistic simulations also in parallel. To improve the scaling properties of the common particle mesh Ewald electrostatics algorithms, we have in addition used a Multiple-Program, Multiple-Data approach, with separate node domains responsible for direct and reciprocal space interactions. Not only does this combination of algorithms enable extremely long simulations of large systems but also it provides that simulation performance on quite modest numbers of standard cluster nodes.},

Of these derivatives, only the l-alanine derivative (1) was found to form the HII phase, using N,N-dimethylformamide as the hydrophilic solvent. To our knowledge, this is one of the rare examples (if not the only example) of a Brønsted acidic amphiphile capable of forming a high-curvature LLC phase. Monomer 1 was also found to be able to direct the formation of the other amide-containing acidic derivatives into the HII phase when blended together.

	abstract = {Nanofiltration membranes (NF) have applications in several areas. One of the main applications has been in watertreatment for drinking water production as well as wastewater treatment. NF can either be used to treat all kinds of water including ground, surface, and wastewater or used as a pretreatment for desalination. The introduction of NF as a pretreatment is considered a breakthrough for the desalination process. NF membranes have been shown to be able to remove turbidity, microorganisms and hardness, as well as a fraction of the dissolved salts. This results in a significantly lower operating pressure and thus provides a much more energy-efficient process. Similar to other membrane processes, a major problem in NF membrane applications is fouling. Several studies have investigated the mechanisms of fouling in NF membranes and suggested methods to minimize and control the fouling of NF membranes. For NF membrane characterizations and process prediction, modeling of NF processes and the use of atomic force microscopy (AFM) are very important. The ability to predict the performance of NF processes will lead to a lower number of experiments, saving of time and money, and help to understand the separation mechanisms during NF. A comprehensive review of NF in water treatments is presented including a review of the applications of NF in treating water as well as in the pretreatment process for desalination; the mechanism as well as minimization of NF membrane fouling problems; and theories for modelling and transport of salt, charged and noncharged organic compounds in NF membranes. The review will also address the application of AFM in studying the morphology of membrane surfaces as part of the NF membrane characterization.},

The TFC QI membrane performance was compared to those of a commercial nanofiltration (NF) membrane (NF270) and a commercial reverse osmosis (RO) membrane (SW30HR) for the filtration of flowback water from the Denver-Julesburg Basin. The permeability, salt rejection, and organic solute rejection for each membrane was evaluated. The results illustrate that the TFC QI membrane maintained its performance to a similar degree as the commercial NF and RO membranes while demonstrating a unique selectivity not observed in the commercial membranes. Specifically, the TFC QI membrane rejected 75\% of the salt while recovering 9.6\% of the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 50\% of the water. Of particular interest was the recovery of labile DOC, which was assessed through biodegradation experiments. Analysis following biodegradation of the TFC QI membrane permeate demonstrates the membrane's ability to recover labile DOC in a reduced-saline permeate. Improved recovery of labile DOC (increased to 22\%) was demonstrated by reducing the pH of the flowback water. Therefore, the selectivity of the TFC QI membrane provides an opportunity to recover resources from hydraulic fracturing flowback.},

	abstract = {The selectivity of a bicontinuous cubic, lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) polymer nanofiltration membrane containing uniform cationic nanopores was manipulated via anion-exchange at the pore wall by soaking the fabricated membranes in aqueous salt solutions. Monovalent organosulfonate anions of various sizes were completely exchanged as the counterion at the pore walls to explore the impact of anion size on uncharged molecular solute rejection and water permeance. It was found that larger organosulfonate anions associated at the pore walls induced a higher rejection of uncharged solutes and a lower water permeance. The change in selectivity of the nanopores was described quantitatively through the calculation of the effective pore radius. The effective pore radius in these modified membranes was found to vary from 0.9±0.2 to 0.55±0.08nm depending on the resident organosulfonate counterion, demonstrating sub-1-nm resolution in pore size manipulation. An empirical model was used to demonstrate that physicochemical properties (molecular volume and hydrophobicity) of the resident counterion correlate with the observed solute rejection, suggesting that the counterion can be chosen to target a desired membrane performance. The ability to manipulate uniform, nm-sized pores with sub-1-nm resolution via simple anion-exchange offers a new avenue to tailor nanofiltration membrane performance.},

Trajectories exhibited intermittent motion consistent with a generalized continuous time random walk (CTRW) model, where strongly confined “waiting times” alternated with rapid flights. The presence of three characteristic regimes emerged as a function of surface coverage, based on an analysis of effective short-time diffusion coefficients, mean-squared displacement, and CTRW distributions. The dilute “site-blocking” regime exhibited increasing short-time diffusion, less confined behavior, and shorter waiting times with higher surface coverage, as anomalously strong adsorption sites were increasingly passivated. At intermediate values of surface coverage, the “crowding” regime was distinguished by the exact opposite trends (slower, more confined mobility), presumably due to increasing intermolecular interactions. The trends reversed yet again in the “brush” regime, where adsorbing molecules interacted weakly with a layer of extended overlapping chains.},

Besides the substances previously recommended to be included by the Directive 39/2013/EU, namely two pharmaceuticals (diclofenac and the synthetic hormone 17-alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2)) and a natural hormone (17-beta-estradiol (E2)), the first watch list of 10 substances/groups of substances also refers three macrolide antibiotics (azithromycin, clarithromycin and erythromycin), other natural hormone (estrone (E1)), some pesticides (methiocarb, oxadiazon, imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, acetamiprid and triallate), a UV filter (2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate) and an antioxidant (2,6-di-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol) commonly used as food additive. Since little is known about the removal of most of the substances included in the Decision 2015/495/EU, particularly regarding realistic concentrations in aqueous environmental samples, this review aims to: (i) overview the European policy in the water field; (ii) briefly describe the most commonly used conventional and advanced treatment processes to remove micropollutants; (iii) summarize the relevant data published in the last decade, regarding occurrence and removal in aqueous matrices of the 10 substances/groups of substances that were recently included in the first watch list for European Union monitoring (Decision 2015/495/EU); and (iv) highlight the lack of reports concerning some substances of the watch list, the study of un-spiked aquatic matrices and the assessment of transformation by-products.},

We demonstrate that, in contrast to the unbounded CTRW, in which ¯¯¯¯δ2 is linear in the lag time Δ, the time-averaged MSD of the CTRW of a walker confined to a finite volume is sublinear in Δ, i.e., for long lag times ¯¯¯¯δ2∼Δ1−α.

	abstract = {Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution—the part of the distribution representing large but rare events—and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out.},

	abstract = {Modern microscopic techniques following the stochastic motion of labelled tracer particles have uncovered significant deviations from the laws of Brownian motion in a variety of animate and inanimate systems. Such anomalous diffusion can have different physical origins, which can be identified from careful data analysis. In particular, single particle tracking provides the entire trajectory of the traced particle, which allows one to evaluate different observables to quantify the dynamics of the system under observation. We here provide an extensive overview over different popular anomalous diffusion models and their properties. We pay special attention to their ergodic properties, highlighting the fact that in several of these models the long time averaged mean squared displacement shows a distinct disparity to the regular, ensemble averaged mean squared displacement. In these cases, data obtained from time averages cannot be interpreted by the standard theoretical results for the ensemble averages. Here we therefore provide a comparison of the main properties of the time averaged mean squared displacement and its statistical behaviour in terms of the scatter of the amplitudes between the time averages obtained from different trajectories. We especially demonstrate how anomalous dynamics may be identified for systems, which, on first sight, appear to be Brownian. Moreover, we discuss the ergodicity breaking parameters for the different anomalous stochastic processes and showcase the physical origins for the various behaviours. This Perspective is intended as a guidebook for both experimentalists and theorists working on systems, which exhibit anomalous diffusion.},

The particles’ mean squared displacement is found to depend on the way the mean is taken: temporal averaging over single-particle trajectories differs from averaging over an ensemble of particles. This is shown to stem from subordinating an ergodic anomalous process to a nonergodic one. The result is easily generalized to the subordination of any other ergodic process (i.e., fractional Brownian motion) to a nonergodic one. For certain parameters the ergodic diffusion on the underlying fractal structure dominates the transport yet displaying ergodicity breaking and aging.},

We investigate by analytic calculations and simulations how time-averaged observables (e.g., the time-averaged mean-squared displacement and displacement correlation) are affected by spatial confinement and dimensionality. In particular, we study the degree of weak ergodicity breaking and scatter between different single trajectories for this confined motion in the subdiffusive domain. The general trend is that deviations from ergodicity are decreased with decreasing size of the movement volume and with increasing dimensionality. We define the displacement correlation function and find that this quantity shows distinct features for fractional Brownian motion, fractional Langevin equation, and continuous time subdiffusion, such that it appears an efficient measure to distinguish these different processes based on single-particle trajectory data.},

Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, we measured the anomalous diffusion exponent α characterizing the dependence of the mean-square displacement of the tracer proteins on time, 〈r2(t)〉∼tα. We observed that the diffusion of proteins in dextran solutions with concentrations up to 400g/l is subdiffusive (α{\textless}1) even at low obstacle concentration. The anomalous diffusion exponent α decreases continuously with increasing obstacle concentration and molecular weight, but does not depend on buffer ionic strength, and neither does it depend strongly on solution temperature. At very high random-coil polymer concentrations, α reaches a limit value of αl≈3/4, which we take to be the signature of a coupling between the motions of the tracer proteins and the segments of the dextran chains. A similar, although less pronounced, subdiffusive behavior is observed for the diffusion of streptavidin in concentrated globular protein solutions. These observations indicate that protein diffusion in the cell cytoplasm and nucleus should be anomalous as well, with consequences for measurements of solute diffusion coefficients in cells and for the modeling of cellular processes relying on diffusion.},

The problem is rendered particularly difficult by the fact that we are not allowed to assume knowledge of the number of people participating in the meeting. To address this problem, we take a Bayesian nonparametric approach to speaker diarization that builds on the hierarchical Dirichlet process hidden Markov model (HDP-HMM) of Teh et al. [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 101 (2006) 1566–1581]. Although the basic HDP-HMM tends to over-segment the audio data—creating redundant states and rapidly switching among them—we describe an augmented HDP-HMM that provides effective control over the switching rate. We also show that this augmentation makes it possible to treat emission distributions nonparametrically. To scale the resulting architecture to realistic diarization problems, we develop a sampling algorithm that employs a truncated approximation of the Dirichlet process to jointly resample the full state sequence, greatly improving mixing rates. Working with a benchmark NIST data set, we show that our Bayesian nonparametric architecture yields state-of-the-art speaker diarization results.},

Some studies find that inflation persistence varied over time, others conclude it was constant. This article contributes further evidence to this ongoing debate by modeling U.S. inflation dynamics using a sticky infinite hidden Markov model (sticky IHMM). The sticky IHMM is a Bayesian nonparametric approach to modeling structural breaks. It allows for an unknown number of breakpoints and is a flexible and attractive alternative to existing methods. We found that inflation persistence was highest in 1973-74 and then again around 1980. However, credible intervals for our estimates of inflation persistence were very wide. Thus, a substantial amount of uncertainty about this aspect of inflation dynamics remained.},

Relaxing this hypothesis and being able to detect which parameters evolve over time is relevant for interpreting the changes in the dynamics of the series, for specifying models parsimoniously, and may be helpful in forecasting. We propose the class of sticky infinite hidden Markov-switching autoregressive moving average models, in which we disentangle the break dynamics of the mean and the variance parameters. In this class, the number of regimes is possibly infinite and is determined when estimating the model, thus avoiding the need to set this number by a model choice criterion. We develop a new Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation method that solves the path dependence issue due to the moving average component. Empirical results on macroeconomic series illustrate that the proposed class of models dominates the model with fixed parameters in terms of point and density forecasts.},

We then considered extensions to Markov switching processes with richer, conditionally linear dynamics, including the HDP-AR-HMM and HDP-SLDS. We concluded by considering methods for transferring knowledge among multiple related time series. We argued that a featural representation is more appropriate than a rigid global clustering, as it encourages sharing of behaviors among objects while still allowing sequence-specific variability.

	abstract = {The uniform size and complex chemical topology of the pores formed by self-assembled amphiphilic molecules such as liquid crystals make them promising candidates for selective separations. In this work, we observe the transport of water, sodium ions, and 20 small polar solutes within the pores of a lyotropic liquid crystal (LLC) membrane using atomistic molecular simulations. We find that the transport of a species is dependent not only on molecular size but also on chemical functionality. The membrane’s inhomogeneous composition gives rise to radially dependent transport mechanisms with respect to the pore centers. We observe that all solutes perform intermittent hops between lengthy periods of entrapment. Three different trapping mechanisms are responsible for this behavior. First, solutes that drift out of the pore can become entangled among the dense monomer tails. Second, solutes can donate hydrogen bonds to the monomer head groups. Third, solutes can coordinate with sodium counterions. The degree to which a solute is affected by each mechanism is dependent on the chemical functionality of the solute. Using the insights developed in this study, we can begin to think about how to redesign existing LLC membranes to perform solute-specific separations.},

	abstract = {Understanding the basis for intracellular motion is critical as the field moves toward a deeper understanding of the relation between Brownian forces, molecular crowding, and anisotropic (or isotropic) energetic forcing. Effective forces and other parameters used to summarize molecular motion change over time in live cells due to latent state changes, e.g., changes induced by dynamic micro-environments, photobleaching, and other heterogeneity inherent in biological processes. This study discusses limitations in currently popular analysis methods (e.g., mean square displacement-based analyses) and how new techniques can be used to systematically analyze Single Particle Tracking (SPT) data experiencing abrupt state changes in time or space. The approach is to track GFP tagged chromatids in metaphase in live yeast cells and quantitatively probe the effective forces resulting from dynamic interactions that reflect the sum of a number of physical phenomena. State changes can be induced by various sources including: microtubule dynamics exerting force through the centromere, thermal polymer fluctuations, and DNA-based molecular machines including polymerases and protein exchange complexes such as chaperones and chromatin remodeling complexes. Simulations aiming to show the relevance of the approach to more general SPT data analyses are also studied. Refined force estimates are obtained by adopting and modifying a nonparametric Bayesian modeling technique, the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Switching Linear Dynamical System (HDP-SLDS), for SPT applications. The HDP-SLDS method shows promise in systematically identifying dynamical regime changes induced by unobserved state changes when the number of underlying states is unknown in advance (a common problem in SPT applications). We expand on the relevance of the HDP-SLDS approach, review the relevant background of Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes, show how to map discrete time HDP-SLDS models to classic SPT models, and discuss limitations of the approach. In addition, we demonstrate new computational techniques for tuning hyperparameters and for checking the statistical consistency of model assumptions directly against individual experimental trajectories; the techniques circumvent the need for “ground-truth” and/or subjective information.},

To simulate aquifer properties, such as logarithmic hydraulic conductivity (ln(K)) variations, fractional Brownian motion (fBm) and truncated fractional Levy motion (fLm) were suggested previously. In this paper, an efficient three-dimensional successive random additions (SRA) algorithm is presented to construct spatial ln(K) distributions. A convenient conditioning procedure using the inverse-distance-weighting method as a data interpolator, which forces the generated fBm or truncated fLm realization to go through known data points, is included also. The proposed method coded in the FORTRAN language, and a complementary code for verifying fractal structure in fBm realizations based on dispersional analysis, are validated carefully through numerical tests. These software packages allow one to go beyond the stationary stochastic process hydrology of the 1980s to the new geo-statistics of non-stationary stochastic processes with stationary increments, as embodied by the stochastic fractals fBm, fLm and their associated increments fGn and fLn.},

	abstract = {To meet the challenge of modeling the conformational dynamics of biological macromolecules over long time scales, much recent effort has been devoted to constructing stochastic kinetic models, often in the form of discrete-state Markov models, from short molecular dynamics simulations. To construct useful models that faithfully represent dynamics at the time scales of interest, it is necessary to decompose configuration space into a set of kinetically metastable states. Previous attempts to define these states have relied upon either prior knowledge of the slow degrees of freedom or on the application of conformational clustering techniques which assume that conformationally distinct clusters are also kinetically distinct. Here, we present a first version of an automatic algorithm for the discovery of kinetically metastable states that is generally applicable to solvated macromolecules. Given molecular dynamics trajectories initiated from a well-defined starting distribution, the algorithm discovers long lived, kinetically metastable states through successive iterations of partitioning and aggregating conformation space into kinetically related regions.

(c) Can we predict the native structure of a protein from its amino acid sequence? Once regarded as a grand challenge, protein folding has seen great progress in recent years. Now, foldable proteins and nonbiological polymers are being designed routinely and moving toward successful applications. The structures of small proteins are now often well predicted by computer methods. And, there is now a testable explanation for how a protein can fold so quickly: A protein solves its large global optimization problem as a series of smaller local optimization problems, growing and assembling the native structure from peptide fragments, local structures first.},

We review the motivations, methods, and caveats of MSMs, as well as some recent highlights of applications of the method.

However, the estimation, validation, and analysis of such models is far from trivial and involves sophisticated and often numerically sensitive methods. In this work we present the open-source Python package PyEMMA (http://pyemma.org) that provides accurate and efficient algorithms for kinetic model construction. PyEMMA can read all common molecular dynamics data formats, helps in the selection of input features, provides easy access to dimension reduction algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA) and time-lagged independent component analysis (TICA) and clustering algorithms such as k-means, and contains estimators for MSMs, hidden Markov models, and several other models. Systematic model validation and error calculation methods are provided. PyEMMA offers a wealth of analysis functions such that the user can conveniently compute molecular observables of interest. We have derived a systematic and accurate way to coarse-grain MSMs to few states and to illustrate the structures of the metastable states of the system. Plotting functions to produce a manuscript-ready presentation of the results are available. In this work, we demonstrate the features of the software and show new methodological concepts and results produced by PyEMMA.},

An approach based on the classical Crank–Nicholson method combined with spatial extrapolation is used to obtain temporally and spatially second-order accurate numerical estimates. Stability, consistency, and (therefore) convergence of the method are examined. It is shown that the fractional Crank–Nicholson method based on the shifted Grünwald formula is unconditionally stable.

Here we study the inﬂuence of surface roughness on the coeﬃcients of self (or tracer) diﬀusion and transport diﬀusion. Considering the ﬁrst four iterations of a generalised fractal Koch surface, we construct pore models of diﬀerent roughness. For these model pores we have performed detailed simulations of both diﬀusion coeﬃcients using a cube-based algorithm. The molecular trajectories can be mapped onto L´evy walks to determine the diﬀusion properties. In linear two-dimensional (2d) channels we observe anomalous diﬀusion, which can also be induced in smooth and rough three-dimensional (3d) pores by anomalous reﬂection laws. Normal diﬀusion is found in convoluted 2d pores and in all 3d pores when a diﬀuse reﬂection law is applied.},

A heterogeneous two-phase model of the gastrointestinal mucosa is considered, consisting of a continuous extracellular phase and a dispersed cellular phase. The main mode of uptake is considered to be a fractional anomalous diffusion under concentration gradient and potential gradient. Appropriate partial differential equations describing the variation with time of concentrations of sodium ions in both the two phases across the intestinal wall are obtained using Riemann-Liouville space-fractional derivative and are solved by finite difference methods. The concentrations of sodium ions in the interstitial space and in the cells have been studied as a function of time, and the mean concentration of sodium ions available for absorption by the blood capillaries has also been studied. Finally, numerical results are presented graphically for various values of different parameters. This study demonstrates that fractional anomalous diffusion model is appropriate for describing the uptake of sodium ions across the epithelium of gastrointestinal mucosa.},

Over many years a basic challenge to the hydrology community has been to develop a theoretical framework that quantitatively accounts for this widespread phenomenon. Recently, continuous time random walk (CTRW) formulations have been demonstrated to provide general and effective means to quantify non-Fickian transport. We introduce and develop the CTRW framework from its conceptual picture of transport through its mathematical development to applications relevant to laboratory- and field-scale systems. The CTRW approach contrasts with ones used extensively on the basis of the advection-dispersion equation and use of upscaling, volume averaging, and homogenization. We examine the underlying assumptions, scope, and differences of these approaches, as well as stochastic formulations, relative to CTRW. We argue why these methods have not been successful in fitting actual measurements. The CTRW has now been developed within the framework of partial differential equations and has been generalized to apply to nonstationary domains and interactions with immobile states (matrix effects). We survey models based on multirate mass transfer (mobile-immobile) and fractional derivatives and show their connection as subsets within the CTRW framework.},

	abstract = {Reservoir heterogeneities and reactive processes strongly affect the fluid flow in porous media. The mechanism of transport and reaction of the fluid varies from pore-to core-scales, leading to the discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations, which are caused by the anomalous diffusion. Also, the reactive processes in porous media may alter reservoir properties in different spatial and temporal scale, varying subsequent transport and reaction behaviors. In this article, the coupled transport and reaction process in heterogeneous porous media is studied. The Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) framework incorporating particle tracking (PT) method is proposed to simulate the transport and reaction processes at pore-scale and show macroscopic behavior at core-scale. Utilizing the CTRW-PT approach, the motion of solute particles is described as a combination of random independent spatial and temporal increments in each walk step. The particle transition distance and time are chosen from a joint space-time probability density function by a stochastic process. The modeling of reaction is followed by the modeling of transport and updates the change of porous media with its effect on following transport and reaction. Simulations of non-reactive tracer and reactive nanofluid flow under different heterogeneity, injection flow rate and rate of reaction were performed. By adjusting the ensemble parameter β and t2 the effects of the above factors on flow behavior are accounted. The concentration profiles with time are displayed to show the effect of heterogeneity, flow rate and rate of reaction on anomalous behavior. Higher level of heterogeneity, higher flow rate and rate of reaction are captured by smaller β and larger t2 quantitatively, representing more anomalous flow behavior. The breakthrough curves from CTRW-PT simulation well match the experimental as well as Advection-Diffusion-Reaction Equation (ADRE) modeling results in most cases. The CTRW results also better match the experimental results than the ADRE as the anomalous behavior becomes significant. It is also found that CTRW-PT simulation as a statistical approach is more computationally efficient than solving the ADRE.},

Conventionally, the number of ions in the pore is inferred by fitting the ratio of inward and outward currents to an exponential function with an adjustable parameter known as the flux ratio exponent. Here we investigate the relationship between the number of ions in the pore and the flux ratio exponent in a model sodium channel under a range of conditions. Brownian dynamics simulations enable us to count the precise number of ions in the channel and at the same time measure the currents flowing across the pore in both directions. We show here that the values of the flux ratio exponent n′ ranges between 1 and 3 and is highly dependent on the ionic concentrations in which measurements are made. This is a consequence of the fact that both inward and outward currents are susceptible to saturation with increasing concentration. These results indicate that measurements of the flux ratio exponent cannot be directly related to the number of ions in the pore and that interpretation of such experimental measurements requires careful consideration of the conditions in which the study is made.},

	abstract = {A computer program, NanoFiltran, was developed to simulate the mass transport of multi-ionic aqueous solutions in charged nanofiltration (NF) membranes, based on the Donnan steric partitioning pore and dielectric exclusion (DSPM\&DE) model, with incorporation of the non-ideality of electrolyte solutions and concentration polarization effects in the membrane/feed-solution interface. With this computer program, the extended Nernst–Planck (ENP) equations are discretized inside the membrane, using the finite-difference scheme. The discretized ENP equations together with the other model equations are linearized in order to obtain a system of equations that are solved simultaneously. The linearized system of equations is based on an initial guess for the electrical potential and ions concentrations profiles, which are updated iteratively. A robust method of under-relaxation of the electrical potential and ions concentrations ensures that the convergence is achieved even for NF systems that exhibit a very stiff numerical behaviour. The prediction of observed solute rejection coefficients compare very well with a set of experimental and numerical values reported in the literature, for a multi-ionic NF system [W.R. Bowen, A.W. Mohammad, Diafiltration by nanofiltration: prediction and optimization, AIChE J. 44(8) (1998) 1799]. The numerical stability of the computer program is analyzed for a very stiff NF system of three ions and the predictions of the concentration and potential profiles within the membrane yielded by the NanoFiltran and by the fourth order Runge–Kutta method are compared and discussed. The results show that NanoFiltran is a valuable tool for accurate and robust prediction of the mass transfer in nanofiltration of multi-ionic solutions. The computer program NanoFiltran is available under a free software license.},

The “Ariadne's clew” we follow is understanding of the general statistical mechanisms which may generate “anomalous” (non-Brownian) diffusion laws; this allows us to develop simple arguments to obtain a qualitative (but often quite accurate) picture of most situations. Several analytical techniques-such as the Green function formalism and renormalization group methods-are also exposed. Care is devoted to the problem of sample to sample fluctuations, particularly acute here. We consider the specific effects of a bias on anomalous diffusion, and discuss the generalizations of Einstein's relation in the presence of disorder. An effort is made to illustrate the theoretical models by describing many physical situations where anomalous diffusion laws have been-or could be-observed.},

Network polymers are useful as model membranes since they are well understood thermodynamically and can be free of inhomogeneities such as pores and crystallinity which obscure results in many systems. The absence of pores assures a diffusional transport mechanism. The degree of swelling of the membrane by solvent is a very important parameter which for hydrocarbon networks can be varied over a wide range without altering polymer structure by selecting from a large number of suitable organic solvents. Solvent transport by an applied pressure differential as in reverse osmosis is considered as well as by downstream vacuum as in pervaporation. Emphasis is given to how the outside driving force causes solvent diffusion in the membrane and relationships between the two different processes. The major factors affecting the diffusion coefficient of solutes in such membranes are discussed.},

New parameters found to be of fundamental importance were introduced to the equation, i.e., the affinity of the solute and the solvent for the membrane expressed as the hydrogen-bonding contribution of the solubility parameter for the solute, solvent and membrane. A graphical map was constructed to predict the solute rejection based on the hydrogen-bonding contribution of the solubility parameter. The model was evaluated with performance data from the literature. Both the solvent flux and the solute rejection calculated with the new approach were similar to values reported in the literature.},

The model is based on different existing models: Hagen–Poiseuille, Jonsson and Boesen, Machado et al. and Bhanushali et al. The newly developed model introduces a correction to the Bhanushali model. Solvent flux appears to be dependent on viscosity, molecular size and the difference in surface tension between the membrane and the solvent. The model was tested on the results of a series of permeability experiments of binary mixtures of water, methanol and/or ethanol, carried out with seven (hydrophilic and hydrophobic) membranes: Desal-5-DK, Desal-5-DL, N30F, NF-PES-010, MPF-44, MPF-50 and SolSep-030505. The model fits indicated a high correlation with experimental results. The new model showed similar fitting results as existing models for hydrophilic membranes. The solvents used have a relatively high degree of affinity for hydrophilic surfaces, resulting in small repulsion forces and consequently a reduced influence of the membrane–solvent interactions. Thus, existing models are sufficient for hydrophilic membranes and the correction for membrane–solvent interactions proposed here has only a small influence. However, a significant improvement was found for the description of the solvent permeability through hydrophobic membranes. For hydrophobic membranes, the relative importance of membrane–solvent interactions/repulsions is increasing for polar solvents. Existing models could not describe the steep increase in permeability for mixtures with high alcohol fractions, whereas the new model fits significantly better.},

Analysis of these transition functions for signatures of Markovian behavior is described. The method has been applied to an example problem that is based on an underlying Markov process. The example problem shows that when an instance of the process is analyzed under the assumption that the underlying states have been aggregated into macrostates, a procedure known as lumping, the resulting chain appears to have been produced by a non-Markovian process when viewed at high temporal resolution. However, when viewed on longer time scales, and for appropriately lumped macrostates, Markovian behavior can be recovered. The potential for extracting the long time scale behavior of the folding process from a large number of short, independent molecular dynamics simulations is also explored.},

Recent global military events, such as the conflict and disarmament in Syria2, have brought into focus the need to find effective strategies for the rapid destruction of these banned chemicals. Solutions are needed for immediate personal protection (for example, the filtration and catalytic destruction of airborne versions of agents), bulk destruction of chemical weapon stockpiles, protection (via coating) of clothing, equipment and buildings, and containment of agent spills3. Solid heterogeneous materials such as modified activated carbon or metal oxides exhibit many desirable characteristics for the destruction of chemical warfare agents4,5,6. However, low sorptive capacities, low effective active site loadings, deactivation of the active site, slow degradation kinetics, and/or a lack of tailorability offer significant room for improvement in these materials. Here, we report a carefully chosen metal–organic framework (MOF) material featuring high porosity and exceptional chemical stability that is extraordinarily effective for the degradation of nerve agents and their simulants.

The advent of single molecule techniques over the past two decades has revolutionized the field of cell biology by providing a more quantitative picture of the complex and highly dynamic organization of living systems.

SPT provides access to single molecule behavior in the natural context of living cells, thereby allowing a complete statistical characterization of the system under study. In this review we describe the foundations of SPT together with novel optical implementations that nowadays allow the investigation of single molecule dynamic events with increasingly high spatiotemporal resolution using molecular densities closer to physiological expression levels. We outline some of the algorithms for the faithful reconstruction of SPT trajectories as well as data analysis, and highlight biological examples where the technique has provided novel insights into the role of diffusion regulating cellular function. The last part of the review concentrates on different theoretical models that describe anomalous transport behavior and ergodicity breaking observed from SPT studies in living cells.},

For power-law forms \$D(x) {\textbackslash}simeq{\textbar}x{\textbar}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}alpha\}\$, this process yield anomalous diffusion of the form \${\textbackslash} {\textless} x{\textasciicircum}2(t){\textbackslash} {\textgreater} {\textbackslash}simeq t{\textasciicircum}\{2/(2-{\textbackslash}alpha)\}\$. Interestingly, in both the sub- and superdiffusive regimes we observe weak ergodicity breaking: the scaling of the time averaged mean squared displacement \${\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}delta{\textasciicircum}2\}\$ remains {\textbackslash}emph\{linear\} and thus differs from the corresponding ensemble average \${\textbackslash} {\textless}x{\textasciicircum}2(t){\textbackslash} {\textgreater}\$. We analyze the non-ergodic behavior of this process in terms of the ergodicity breaking parameters and the distribution of amplitude scatter of \${\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}delta{\textasciicircum}2\}\$. This model represents an alternative approach to non-ergodic, anomalous diffusion that might be particularly relevant for diffusion in heterogeneous media.},
