The files in this folder are for the purpose of calculating SAXS (Small Angle Xray Scattering) profiles based on the results of 
MD simulations.

Intensity is the main file associated with this calculation. The other files are bits and pieces being worked on separately in 
order to properly build up 'Intensity'
